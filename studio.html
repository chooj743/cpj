                <div class="a">
                The start to the compendium jumps quite quickly into elaborating on computation thinking, and a couple of sentences to set the context would have aided a greater understanding of the reason for the study. The compendium was able to establish a purpose for the study of both LeWitt and Moniker’s work, guided by a question of whether operating with rules and conditions affects creativity adversely. Some statements in the writing can be better clarified, for example <mark>what you mean by computation in design being the basis of the study</mark> can be better addressed by first clarifying how do you see works of both parties as fitting with computation or related ways of thinking. At the moment, that is implied and could be better articulated in writing. The formatting of the case studies follows a structured flow. The comparison of both parties’ approaches are done fairly well editorially, highlighting the possible relationships between the two. You were able to relate the insights uncovered from the study to your own thinking as a designer. In discussing your thoughts for future directions, it is <mark>not necessary to already decide what specific mediums that your research will take the form of (in this case, a website) because that can limit where the research can take you</mark>. Instead, it should follow the area of inquiry (in this case, conditional design thinking) to allow the process of understanding and discovery to guide the project. The area of research offers opportunities for expansion into future inquiries.<br><br>

                Take note to edit and vet through your content: pg10 is a repeat of pg8’s content; sentences and passages can connect better with each other. In general, the layout for the compendium is well considered and the use of images and their composition in relation to each other has added value and meaning to the discussion of the case studies. You could further explore how else to sequence and arrange the images selected.

                <h1>Random Ideas and Thoughts for FYP</h1>
                During the holidays I was watching videos and reading article as I do not have a clue to what subject to focus on yet. So here is a very much casually written brief.<br><br>
                <b>Subject 1 – Kids</b><br>
                After watching <a href="https://casholman.com/"target="_blank">Cas Holman</a>: Design for Play on Netflix's, Abstract: The Art of Design she talked about how children do not like to be told what to do. Holman's toys are designed to work as a modular unit; able to grow and morph into what imagination brings. Upon hearing this, my brain draw connections from the whole 'instructional' thing. In both Sol LeWitt & Moniker's works it does not require a genius to be able to execute the works but rather the 'instructions' have to be clearly written in order to avoid misunderstandings.
                <br><br>
                <div class="b">
                    <l>Question/Thoughts</l>: If 
                    <div class="tooltip">conditional is not instructional
                    <span class="tooltiptext">Instructional means strictly working within the specific given instructions. Whereas, Conditional means working around within the limits of the given framework.
                    </span>
                    </div> (and easy to understand) like how Luna <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7K50vlauwQ&t=4m42s" target="_blank">talked about</a>, children would be able to have fun.
                    <br>
                    <l>Target Audience</l>: Children Under 10 years old
                    <br>
                    <l>Challenges</l>: Come out with tasks which are ideally understood by kids yet able to have fun.
                    <br>
                    <l>Significance</l>: Puts the whole theory for a test.
                </div>
                <br>

                <b>Subject 2 – Real-Time Platform for Creatives</b><br>
                At the last page of my compendium I wrote:<br>
                <div class="a">
                <i>"As designers, there are instances where one got a chance to work on collaborative projects with others. However, there seems to be a segregation between both. Instead of merging ideas into something new, many participants just did what they wanted and just blindly join ideas together. Are we really collaborating with each other?"</i>
                </div>
                After doing my research, I've <a href="https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/the-design-collaboration-platform-thats-gone-viral/"target="_blank">found</a> that there is an existing <a href="http://www.open-collab.org/"target="_blank">collaborative platform</a> for students done by Patrick Thomas.
                <br><br>
                <div class="b">
                    <l>Question/Thoughts</l>: Casual collaboration within creatives not practice often enough. It is usually done when job requires us to or schools called us to. 
                    <br>
                    <l>Target Audience</l>: Creative individuals
                    <br>
                    <l>Challenges</l>: Limited technical skills? LOL
                    <br>
                    <l>Significance</l>: Ideas tends to bounce of one another better than trying to work with only ourselves. All would benefit greatly off of each other and expand our creative thinking or problem solving skills.
                </div>

                <br><br>
                <img src="contents/dollar.png"  width="auto" height="15"> I've decided to take a step back because my brain continues to run around in circles despite repeatedly banging onto the same wall. What is new for me is that tackling a brief with an exsisting problem seems easier but was something I did not want to blindly do. It is hard to think about a subject without imagining the outcome. Without knowing I find myself reading articles in all kinds of possible directions, I guess I am damn lost. So with what I've got, I just submitted my Subject 2 for my design brief deadline.

                I've been following Song on social media for quite some time now but it is pretty hard to find information about her or her works (other than the short captions from her insta post).

                Song's works always seem to challenge the boundries of given systems. <a href="https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/ones-to-watch-2020-yehwan-song-digital-240220"target="_blank">Anti-user-friendly</a> is one of my favorite works from Song countering the idea of rather than how interface should have been. She explained in a video that she was reading about how designers talked about having the "perfect" standardised interface almost like a do or die. But Song felt that if in doing so users repetitive behaviour would result in losing their content awareness.

                <h1>Draft 01: Design Brief</h1>
                <l>Design Statement</l><br>This project aims to promote community engagement within creative individuals around the world regardless of location or backgrounds.<br><br>

                <l>Context of Project</l><br>Conditional design carries out a great use of linguistic communication towards their participants. These guidelines have to be simple and easy to understand and well written with logic. It is working around within the limits of the given framework. As fellow designers approach projects, algorithmic thinking would enhance problem solving skills and alter their perception towards countering risen issues. In this situation, the final outcome is barely significant but rather it is about the process during the making.
                <br><br>
                It is important to develop a framework in order to guide the process. Thus in other similar situations, the set of frameworks can still be applied. One could perceive working with rules and conditions destroys creativity, however is it really the case?
                <br><br>

                An idea with logic strengthens the concept and adds functionality purpose. Though logic is not absolutely necessary but would greatly benefit from it in the long term.
                <br><br>

                <l>Objective of Project</l><br>As designers, there are instances where one got a chance to work on collaborative projects with others. However, there seems to be a segregation between both. Instead of merging ideas into something new, many participants just did what they wanted and just blindly attach ideas together. Are we really collaborating with each other
                <br><br>

                Knowledge, methods and advice are meant to be shared and there is so much to learn from each other. Creatives tend to grow better by communicating or interacting with another creative.
                <br><br>


                <l>Significance of Project</l><br>One of the perks of the Internet is having the power to constantly change and update data being stored or shown to the public users. By creating an online platform creatives could exchange their creativity and knowledge with each other across the world.

                <img src="contents/speech.png"  width="auto" height="15"> Stanley comments on first draft of design brief:<br><br>

                <div class="a">
                &#10122; The brief details a clear focus of the research, i.e. conditional design, and it provides a good basis for further discussions with regard to the research on the topic can branch into.<br><br>

                &#10123; At the moment, the design statement does not yet reveal how conditional design can play a role in promoting community engagement. Having said that, the design statement can be tricky to write at the start because it is seen as a distillation of the gist of your research into one statement. So don’t worry, we will get there through iterative revisions of it together.<br><br>

                &#10124; Reading the ‘Context of Project’ section pulls up a number of terms that are worth a deeper look. Particularly ‘problem solving’, ‘process’, and ‘creativity’, although these terms are deeply connected in our vocabulary as designers, some scholars have gone on to elaborate on <mark>how ‘problem solving’ can sometimes be antithetical to ‘process’. Especially so when ‘problem-solving’ is approached from a deterministic view, i.e. when designers are posed with a problem, they immediately imagine what can solve it and just work towards that without considering other possibilities.</mark> So in this view, <mark>the ‘process’ is merely the ‘process’ of materialising the solution and not the expansive perspective of process that allows for discovery and flexible redirection of ideas.</mark> Rosner terms this view as solutionism, in her book, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/critical-fabulations"target="_blank">Critical Fabulation</a>. I took a photo of that page in the book; hopefully it is not too hard to read (see attached). Just to be clear, <mark>there is no problem with identifying or solving problems, but it’s the way we approach it that can be an issue.</mark><br><br>

                &#10125; So it can be argued that in this linear view of ‘process’, ‘creativity’ is also hampered. Which perhaps can give reason to why you believe conditional design can realign our perspectives since <mark>conditional design does not ‘predict’ the outcome but requires us to follow a process.</mark><br><br>

                &#10126; What I miss from the context is the point on promoting community engagement, which was mentioned in the design statement above it. The context section can be read from an individual designer’s point-of-view as opposed to a collective one. The need for collaboration is becoming necessary, especially so in our expanding networked environment. <mark>With more complex societal problems, it requires the solidarity of many coming together rather than the solo efforts alone, as the recent health and racial crisis has shown us too</mark>. But <mark>how can we nurture a more collaborative way of thinking that goes against outdated and oppressive dominant ideologies that tends to celebrate the single genius designer and create a hierarchy of power and competition?</mark> Perhaps conditional design can spark the thought that a person is seen as <mark>a part of a whole, and in doing so, it may allow us to nurture and rehabilitate us towards a more collaborative perspective.</mark><br><br>

                &#10127; And this aligns really well with what you wrote for the ‘Objective of Project’ where it focuses on collaboration. So piecing what you wrote and thinking out loud here, your project could be experiments with conditional design, by <mark>developing frameworks (of thinking), tools of (making) and/or explorations (of work) through a collaborative environment</mark>. If so, the ‘Context of Project’ should include <mark>why collaboration is imperative for our times.</mark> But I think having the ‘around the world’ is potentially exciting but also daunting, perhaps you can start with small-scale experiments and explorations first that then are scalable in the future. And since the nature of the project is experimental, these small experiments can fail, then you document and communicate how and why they failed.<br><br>

                &#10128; On the note of the importance of collaboration, <a href="https://sandberg.nl/anja-groten/staff" target="_blank">Anja Groten</a> from Sandberg Institute, said “…acknowledge that collaboration is not a choice. Collaboration as a condition acting and reacting at all times, and inhibiting power relations.” This is from her article, Towards A Critical Collaborative Practice, in the book <a href="https://www.valiz.nl/publicaties/design-dedication-adaptive-mentalities-in-design-education.html" target="_blank">Design Dedication</a>.<br><br>

                &#10129; And to answer your question in the follow-up email, yes you can tweak the brief. It is always important to consider other possibilities (as some of my points above have alluded to, haha!) since one area of research can have different project trajectories. For example, you could build on conditional design’s approach to build generative systems for typographic systems (along the lines of some of the work of <a href="https://designobserver.com/feature/parametric-posters-from-muirmcneil/38520" target="_blank">MuirMcNeil</a>).</div>

                <h1>Presentation Slides</h1>
                <l>Who?</l>
                <br>Back in 2008, the term was first introduced by <a href="https://eude.nl/" target="_blank">Edo Paulus</a>, <a href="https://www.jonathanpuckey.com/pages/about/" target="_blank">Jonathan Puckey</a>, <a href="https://www.xelor.nl/" target="_blank">Roel Wouters</a> and <a href="https://poly-luna.com/static/localhost_8888/luna/index.html" target="_blank">Luna Maurer</a>. It was during one of their <a href="https://conditionaldesign.org/index.html" target="_blank">weekly Tuesday night</a> sessions. They are constantly switching between each discipline and needed a term to define what they are doing. As a result, a <a href="https://conditionaldesign.org/manifesto/" target="_blank">Manifesto</a> was created by this group of four people.<br><br>
                Founded in 2012 by Luna Maurer and Jonathan Puckey <a href="http://studiomoniker.com/" target="_blank">Studio Moniker</a> was formed. However due to Jonathan’s <a href="https://puckey.studio/" target="_blank">departure</a> in 2016, the studio is currently run by Luna Maurer and Roel Wouters. Moniker is an interactive design studio from Amsterdam constantly exploring the social effects of technology on how it influence us as humans.
                <br><br>


                <l>What?</l><br><br>
                <img src="https://imgur.com/yg2KpxS.png"  width="auto" height="200" class="photos">
                <br>You've heard of the famous saying "Think Outside the Box", but except it is the opposite of it: Think Within the Box! Conditional means working around within the limits of the given designed framework. This method focus on the process rather than the final outcome. <br><br>

                <img src="https://imgur.com/3c6cA2y.png"  width="600" height="auto" class="photos"><br>
                There is no specific conclusion of when the works are completed as Moniker's framework is highly dependent on the process of crowd's participation within the environment its being held at. In some cases, some works are online and it will end when it lacks visitors as it is expensive to keep it live. However, Moniker's ideas have no end and could be applied repeatedly on different occasions.
                <br><br>

                <l>'Participation'</l><br><br>
                <img src="https://imgur.com/PhyMkuv.png"  width="auto" height="200" class="photos">
                <br>According to an interview with Ruby Boddington on It's Nice That, Luna explains that participation with Moniker is rather 'restricted'. Rather than self expression it is about answering questions or filling up a given blank space given by Moniker.
                <br><br>

                <l>Fungus Series (2008 – 2016) by Studio Moniker</l><br><br>

                <br>As the exhibition ran its course, certain behaviour patterns start to surface. Everyone are always trying to find meaning as to where they position their stickers. It is impossible not to as the conditions requires participants so link it next to another. The graph above illustrate the pros and cons of the type of participants. There are some who found their way to work around the system creating more control for themselves Moniker calls them 'Hackers'.

                Design Thinking:<br>
                → User-centered approach (Empathy): Why is this a problem?<br> 
                → Specific problem<br>
                → Focues on the outcome (solution)<br>
                <br>
                Computational Thinking:<br>
                → Algorithmic thinking: Breaks complex problems into systematically into steps<br> 
                → Data driven<br>
                → Focues on the process<br>
                → Replicable methods<br>
                <br><br>
                According to an <a href="https://equip.learning.com/computational-thinking-algorithmic-thinking-design-thinking" target="_blank">article</a> by Murphy,

                <img src="contents/speech.png"  width="auto" height="15"> Stanley comments on my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GccnSH-XqEZNoYWQnWS7RYGVA_Dv3mNH/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">presentation slides</a>:<br><br>

                <div class="a">
                (start of voice recording)...thing and interaction with people. There are good things to it, some of you might remember I rant about design thinking in the past there are also bad things about it... alright? So thats where you can ah slip in "but Conditional Design does this..." then you can articulate where "<mark>How does Conditional Design maybe nature a different way of building knowledge?</mark>" And besides naturing a different way of knowledge it also <mark>changes the way we think about design</mark>. Previously we talked about design thinking, as much as they say they work with people, speak with people, they treat people as information to be extracted from. All of us has done forms of design thinking: interview people, you get information from them, process it and then you do something about it. What <mark>Conditional Design does is that they treat people as part of the design process that means they actually contribute to the design process</mark>. It is not just listening to them and then you think about what you want to do about it. So that also <mark>changes about what you think is possible in design.</mark><br><br>
                This is a good segue to talk a little bit about differences between theory and practice for you dissertation and studio, this is for everyone ah. Although the project is tied quite closely, they are the same project actually. For dissertation you write about theoretical issues behind your project. So I can imagine for your dissertation <mark>you can write about how a practice of more critical practice of Conditional Design can challange and overcome certain dominal ways of thinking that has been inculcated through design thinking. That will require you to first discuss what are the good and bad things about design thinking then you say Conditional Design into that.</mark><br><br>
                Then in your studio you don't have to do that because in theory you already argue why you do that. In studio you can just do experiments to challange that lor. You want to try how many different ways you can include participants, how many different ways you can set conditions to design something different and then it just becomes a collection of a 100 or 200 (there can be 1 or 2 also if its on a large scale). Exercises that you want to explore because you are saying that other designers can draw from these experiments of yours even if there are mistakes it is fine. You can give people stickers they can do however they want to do with it. But its your attempt to get people to try it and also get designers to try it and then to record their thoughts about it; see whether is this the way they really look into design.<br><br>
                Another thing that I could share, in the line of art there is a operating that seems like a very early form of conditional design, atleast to me, although the conditions here are very loose, its called the Exquisite Corpse. It is a method of drawing for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=exquisite+corpse+drawing&sxsrf=ALeKk02uYkVc_ECJyUkAEriCwEg6_q9whg:1599986024742&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwibz5m13OXrAhUHb30KHQYYD-wQ_AUoAXoECBEQAw&biw=1440&bih=798" target="_blank">example</a>. You are <mark>reading off what the person has drawn before you and try to connect and sometime you would purposely want to disrupt it.</mark> It is a very early from of art making but you can do alot of different things now. Conditional Design doesn't have to be done through hand and it can be digital, it can be with your body, continue things from analog to a digital stage also possible.<br><br><br>

                For my studio what direction am I suppose to head towards to? Because right now Conditional Design is very broad. Am I suppose to think of what to create or follow what has already exsisted?

                ...because what you saw was looking at other poeple go through it e.g. Fungus Series, what if you create your own just to get a sense of what it was like rather than from second hand or third hand account right? You'll have a first hand expirence of it and that could be it.<br><br>
                Maybe this might help everyone else as well alot of times I recall the conversations I have with many of you during presentations, the feedback I have for your presentations I talk alot of <mark>collating exsisting examples of what you are doing. Take a specific attempt to look at it, filter out. So for e.g. you're looking at some of their methods you can start dissecting their methods lor. Some methods have more people, some methods use tools that are different from people and then think about wheater is it a similar track for all of them, like how loose where the conditions, how restrictive were they. And then think of the experience also, if you were to study some of these case studies that they have done: what did the participants do?, how many of them broke the law?, how many of them tried something different? and how did that change the result?</mark>
