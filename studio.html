                <div class="a">
                The start to the compendium jumps quite quickly into elaborating on computation thinking, and a couple of sentences to set the context would have aided a greater understanding of the reason for the study. The compendium was able to establish a purpose for the study of both LeWitt and Moniker’s work, guided by a question of whether operating with rules and conditions affects creativity adversely. Some statements in the writing can be better clarified, for example <mark>what you mean by computation in design being the basis of the study</mark> can be better addressed by first clarifying how do you see works of both parties as fitting with computation or related ways of thinking. At the moment, that is implied and could be better articulated in writing. The formatting of the case studies follows a structured flow. The comparison of both parties’ approaches are done fairly well editorially, highlighting the possible relationships between the two. You were able to relate the insights uncovered from the study to your own thinking as a designer. In discussing your thoughts for future directions, it is <mark>not necessary to already decide what specific mediums that your research will take the form of (in this case, a website) because that can limit where the research can take you</mark>. Instead, it should follow the area of inquiry (in this case, conditional design thinking) to allow the process of understanding and discovery to guide the project. The area of research offers opportunities for expansion into future inquiries.<br><br>

                Take note to edit and vet through your content: pg10 is a repeat of pg8’s content; sentences and passages can connect better with each other. In general, the layout for the compendium is well considered and the use of images and their composition in relation to each other has added value and meaning to the discussion of the case studies. You could further explore how else to sequence and arrange the images selected.

                    <h1>Random Ideas and Thoughts for FYP</h1>
                    During the holidays I was watching videos and reading article as I do not have a clue to what subject to focus on yet. So here is a very much casually written brief.<br><br>
                    <b>Subject 1 – Kids</b><br>
                    After watching <a href="https://casholman.com/"target="_blank">Cas Holman</a>: Design for Play on Netflix's, Abstract: The Art of Design she talked about how children do not like to be told what to do. Holman's toys are designed to work as a modular unit; able to grow and morph into what imagination brings. Upon hearing this, my brain draw connections from the whole 'instructional' thing. In both Sol LeWitt & Moniker's works it does not require a genius to be able to execute the works but rather the 'instructions' have to be clearly written in order to avoid misunderstandings.
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="b">
                        <l>Question/Thoughts</l>:<br>
                        <i>"Instructional means strictly working within the specific given instructions. Whereas, Conditional means working around within the limits of the given framework."</i> —pg iii of my Conditional Design Compendium<br>
                        If conditional is not instructional (and easy to understand) like how Luna <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7K50vlauwQ&t=4m42s" target="_blank">talked about</a>, children would be able to have fun.
                        <br>
                        <l>Target Audience</l>: Children range 6 to 12 years old
                        <br>
                        <l>Challenges</l>: Come out with tasks which are ideally understood by kids yet able to have fun.
                        <br>
                        <l>Significance</l>: Puts the whole theory for a test.
                    </div>
                    <br>

                    <b>Subject 2 – Real-Time Platform for Creatives</b><br>
                    At the last page of my compendium I wrote:<br>
                    <div class="a">
                    <i>"As designers, there are instances where one got a chance to work on collaborative projects with others. However, there seems to be a segregation between both. Instead of merging ideas into something new, many participants just did what they wanted and just blindly join ideas together. Are we really collaborating with each other?"</i>
                    </div>
                    After doing my research, I've <a href="https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/the-design-collaboration-platform-thats-gone-viral/"target="_blank">found</a> that there is an existing <a href="http://www.open-collab.org/"target="_blank">collaborative platform</a> for students done by Patrick Thomas.
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="b">
                        <l>Question/Thoughts</l>: Casual collaboration within creatives not practice often enough. It is usually done when job requires us to or schools called us to. 
                        <br>
                        <l>Target Audience</l>: Creative individuals
                        <br>
                        <l>Challenges</l>: Limited technical skills? LOL
                        <br>
                        <l>Significance</l>: Ideas tends to bounce of one another better than trying to work with only ourselves. All would benefit greatly off of each other and expand our creative thinking or problem solving skills.
                    </div>

                    <br><br>
                    <img src="contents/dollar.png"  width="auto" height="15"> I've decided to take a step back because my brain continues to run around in circles despite repeatedly banging onto the same wall. What is new for me is that tackling a brief with an exsisting problem seems easier but was something I did not want to blindly do. It is hard to think about a subject without imagining the outcome. Without knowing I find myself reading articles in all kinds of possible directions, I guess I am damn lost. So with what I've got, I just submitted my Subject 2 for my design brief deadline.

                    I've been following Song on social media for quite some time now but it is pretty hard to find information about her or her works (other than the short captions from her insta post).

                    Song's works always seem to challenge the boundries of given systems. Anti-user-friendly series (<a href="http://yhsong.com/inverted/01.html"target="_blank">#01</a>, <a href="http://yhsong.com/inverted/02.html"target="_blank">#02</a> & <a href="http://www.yhsong.com/detail.html#Anti_User_friendly_Match_my_four_fingers"target="_blank">Moblie App</a>) is one of my favorite works from Song countering the idea of rather than how interface should have been. She explained in a video that she was reading about how designers talked about having the "perfect" standardised interface almost like a do or die. But Song felt that if in doing so users repetitive behaviour would result in losing their content awareness.

                    <h1>Draft 01: Design Brief</h1>
                    <l>Design Statement</l><br>This project aims to promote community engagement within creative individuals around the world regardless of location or backgrounds.<br><br>

                    <l>Context of Project</l><br>Conditional design carries out a great use of linguistic communication towards their participants. These guidelines have to be simple and easy to understand and well written with logic. It is working around within the limits of the given framework. As fellow designers approach projects, algorithmic thinking would enhance problem solving skills and alter their perception towards countering risen issues. In this situation, the final outcome is barely significant but rather it is about the process during the making.
                    <br><br>
                    It is important to develop a framework in order to guide the process. Thus in other similar situations, the set of frameworks can still be applied. One could perceive working with rules and conditions destroys creativity, however is it really the case?
                    <br><br>

                    An idea with logic strengthens the concept and adds functionality purpose. Though logic is not absolutely necessary but would greatly benefit from it in the long term.
                    <br><br>

                    <l>Objective of Project</l><br>As designers, there are instances where one got a chance to work on collaborative projects with others. However, there seems to be a segregation between both. Instead of merging ideas into something new, many participants just did what they wanted and just blindly attach ideas together. Are we really collaborating with each other
                    <br><br>

                    Knowledge, methods and advice are meant to be shared and there is so much to learn from each other. Creatives tend to grow better by communicating or interacting with another creative.
                    <br><br>


                    <l>Significance of Project</l><br>One of the perks of the Internet is having the power to constantly change and update data being stored or shown to the public users. By creating an online platform creatives could exchange their creativity and knowledge with each other across the world.

                <div class="breaker"></div><br>

                    <img src="contents/speech.png"  width="auto" height="15"> Stanley comments on first draft of design brief:<br><br>

                    <div class="a">
                    &#10122; The brief details a clear focus of the research, i.e. conditional design, and it provides a good basis for further discussions with regard to the research on the topic can branch into.<br><br>

                    &#10123; At the moment, the design statement does not yet reveal how conditional design can play a role in promoting community engagement. Having said that, the design statement can be tricky to write at the start because it is seen as a distillation of the gist of your research into one statement. So don’t worry, we will get there through iterative revisions of it together.<br><br>

                    &#10124; Reading the ‘Context of Project’ section pulls up a number of terms that are worth a deeper look. Particularly ‘problem solving’, ‘process’, and ‘creativity’, although these terms are deeply connected in our vocabulary as designers, some scholars have gone on to elaborate on <mark>how ‘problem solving’ can sometimes be antithetical to ‘process’. Especially so when ‘problem-solving’ is approached from a deterministic view, i.e. when designers are posed with a problem, they immediately imagine what can solve it and just work towards that without considering other possibilities.</mark> So in this view, <mark>the ‘process’ is merely the ‘process’ of materialising the solution and not the expansive perspective of process that allows for discovery and flexible redirection of ideas.</mark> Rosner terms this view as solutionism, in her book, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/critical-fabulations"target="_blank">Critical Fabulation</a>. I took a photo of that page in the book; hopefully it is not too hard to read (see attached). Just to be clear, <mark>there is no problem with identifying or solving problems, but it’s the way we approach it that can be an issue.</mark><br><br>

                    &#10125; So it can be argued that in this linear view of ‘process’, ‘creativity’ is also hampered. Which perhaps can give reason to why you believe conditional design can realign our perspectives since <mark>conditional design does not ‘predict’ the outcome but requires us to follow a process.</mark><br><br>

                    &#10126; What I miss from the context is the point on promoting community engagement, which was mentioned in the design statement above it. The context section can be read from an individual designer’s point-of-view as opposed to a collective one. The need for collaboration is becoming necessary, especially so in our expanding networked environment. <mark>With more complex societal problems, it requires the solidarity of many coming together rather than the solo efforts alone, as the recent health and racial crisis has shown us too</mark>. But <mark>how can we nurture a more collaborative way of thinking that goes against outdated and oppressive dominant ideologies that tends to celebrate the single genius designer and create a hierarchy of power and competition?</mark> Perhaps conditional design can spark the thought that a person is seen as <mark>a part of a whole, and in doing so, it may allow us to nurture and rehabilitate us towards a more collaborative perspective.</mark><br><br>

                    &#10127; And this aligns really well with what you wrote for the ‘Objective of Project’ where it focuses on collaboration. So piecing what you wrote and thinking out loud here, your project could be experiments with conditional design, by <mark>developing frameworks (of thinking), tools of (making) and/or explorations (of work) through a collaborative environment</mark>. If so, the ‘Context of Project’ should include <mark>why collaboration is imperative for our times.</mark> But I think having the ‘around the world’ is potentially exciting but also daunting, perhaps you can start with small-scale experiments and explorations first that then are scalable in the future. And since the nature of the project is experimental, these small experiments can fail, then you document and communicate how and why they failed.<br><br>

                    &#10128; On the note of the importance of collaboration, <a href="https://sandberg.nl/anja-groten/staff" target="_blank">Anja Groten</a> from Sandberg Institute, said “…acknowledge that collaboration is not a choice. Collaboration as a condition acting and reacting at all times, and inhibiting power relations.” This is from her article, Towards A Critical Collaborative Practice, in the book <a href="https://www.valiz.nl/publicaties/design-dedication-adaptive-mentalities-in-design-education.html" target="_blank">Design Dedication</a>.<br><br>

                    &#10129; And to answer your question in the follow-up email, yes you can tweak the brief. It is always important to consider other possibilities (as some of my points above have alluded to, haha!) since one area of research can have different project trajectories. For example, you could build on conditional design’s approach to build generative systems for typographic systems (along the lines of some of the work of <a href="https://designobserver.com/feature/parametric-posters-from-muirmcneil/38520" target="_blank">MuirMcNeil</a>).</div>

                Back in 2008, the term was first introduced by <a href="https://eude.nl/" target="_blank">Edo Paulus</a>, <a href="https://www.jonathanpuckey.com/pages/about/" target="_blank">Jonathan Puckey</a>, <a href="https://www.xelor.nl/" target="_blank">Roel Wouters</a> and <a href="https://poly-luna.com/static/localhost_8888/luna/index.html" target="_blank">Luna Maurer</a>. It was during one of their <a href="https://conditionaldesign.org/index.html" target="_blank">weekly Tuesday night</a> sessions. They are constantly switching between each discipline and needed a term to define what they are doing. As a result, a <a href="https://conditionaldesign.org/manifesto/" target="_blank">Manifesto</a> was created by this group of four people.<br><br>
                Founded in 2012 by Luna Maurer and Jonathan Puckey, <a href="http://studiomoniker.com/" target="_blank">Studio Moniker</a> was formed. However due to Jonathan’s <a href="https://puckey.studio/" target="_blank">departure</a> in 2016, the studio is currently run by Luna Maurer and Roel Wouters. Moniker is an interactive design studio from Amsterdam constantly exploring the social effects of technology on how it influence us as humans.

                <img src="https://imgur.com/yg2KpxS.png"  width="auto" height="200" class="photos">
                <br>You've heard of the famous saying "Think Outside the Box", but except it is the opposite of it: Think Within the Box! Conditional means working around within the limits of the given designed framework. This method focus on the process rather than the final outcome. <br><br>

                There is no specific conclusion of when the works are completed as Moniker's framework is highly dependent on the process of crowd's participation within the environment its being held at. In some cases, some works are online and it will end when it lacks visitors as it is expensive to keep it live. However, Moniker's ideas have no end and could be applied repeatedly on different occasions.

                <br>According to an <a href="https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/studio-moniker-digital-060520" target="_blank">interview</a> with Ruby Boddington, Luna explains that participation with Moniker is rather 'restricted'. Rather than self expression it is about answering questions or filling up a given blank space given by Moniker.

                As the exhibition ran its course, certain behaviour patterns start to surface. Everyone are always trying to find meaning as to where they position their stickers. It is impossible not to as the conditions requires participants so link it next to another. The graph above illustrate the pros and cons of the type of participants. There are some who found their way to work around the system creating more control for themselves Moniker calls them 'Hackers'.

                <l>Design Thinking vs. Computational Thinking</l><br>

                According to an <a href="https://equip.learning.com/computational-thinking-algorithmic-thinking-design-thinking" target="_blank">article</a> by Murphy:
                Design thinking's approach is user-centered, based on empathising why is this a problem. Its starts off on a specific problem and focues on finding a solution. However, computational thinking's approach uses algorithmic thinking that breaks down complex problems into systematically into steps. Driven by data, its methods are replicable and focues on the process over outcome.

                Moving on to controlling idea... As I was writing down my thoughts in the journal I noticed how ugly my handwriting was. I've always had difficulties signing my signatures as I couldn't get it to look consistent. It led me to think about how technology influence the way we write in the past few years. We write with our hand holding on to the pen on the paper. However, it shifted to mouse cursor on screen when computer softwares were created. Followed by the current "finger writing" commonly used on Instragram story canvas.<br><br>
                Additionally, I felt that fonts are dehumanised; created for a greater legibility and efficiency. Human's writing shows a lot about their personalities but is not always legible. In that case a letter stops looking like a letter itself (at what point does 'G' stops looking like a 'G')?

                <h1>Presentation Feedback</h1>
                <img src="contents/speech.png"  width="auto" height="15"> Stanley comments on my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GccnSH-XqEZNoYWQnWS7RYGVA_Dv3mNH/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">presentation slides</a>:<br><br>

                <div class="a">
                (start of voice recording)...thing and interaction with people. There are good things to it, some of you might remember I rant about design thinking in the past there are also bad things about it... alright? So thats where you can ah slip in "but Conditional Design does this..." then you can articulate where "<mark>How does Conditional Design maybe nurture a different way of building knowledge?</mark>" And besides naturing a different way of knowledge it also <mark>changes the way we think about design</mark>. Previously we talked about design thinking, as much as they say they work with people, speak with people, they treat people as information to be extracted from. All of us has done forms of design thinking: interview people, you get information from them, process it and then you do something about it. What <mark>Conditional Design does is that they treat people as part of the design process that means they actually contribute to the design process</mark>. It is not just listening to them and then you think about what you want to do about it. So that also <mark>changes about what you think is possible in design.</mark><br><br>
                This is a good segue to talk a little bit about differences between theory and practice for you dissertation and studio, this is for everyone ah. Although the project is tied quite closely, they are the same project actually. For dissertation you write about theoretical issues behind your project. So I can imagine for your dissertation <mark>you can write about how a practice of more critical practice of Conditional Design can challenge and overcome certain dominal ways of thinking that has been inculcated through design thinking. That will require you to first discuss what are the good and bad things about design thinking then you say Conditional Design into that.</mark><br><br>
                Then in your studio you don't have to do that because in theory you already argue why you do that. In studio you can just do experiments to challenge that lor. You want to try how many different ways you can include participants, how many different ways you can set conditions to design something different and then it just becomes a collection of a 100 or 200 (there can be 1 or 2 also if its on a large scale). Exercises that you want to explore because you are saying that other designers can draw from these experiments of yours even if there are mistakes it is fine. You can give people stickers they can do however they want to do with it. But its your attempt to get people to try it and also get designers to try it and then to record their thoughts about it; see whether is this the way they really look into design.<br><br>
                Another thing that I could share, in the line of art there is a operating that seems like a very early form of conditional design, atleast to me, although the conditions here are very loose, its called the Exquisite Corpse. It is a method of drawing for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=exquisite+corpse+drawing&sxsrf=ALeKk02uYkVc_ECJyUkAEriCwEg6_q9whg:1599986024742&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwibz5m13OXrAhUHb30KHQYYD-wQ_AUoAXoECBEQAw&biw=1440&bih=798" target="_blank">example</a>. You are <mark>reading off what the person has drawn before you and try to connect and sometime you would purposely want to disrupt it.</mark> It is a very early from of art making but you can do alot of different things now. Conditional Design doesn't have to be done through hand and it can be digital, it can be with your body, continue things from analog to a digital stage also possible.<br><br><br>

                <div class="a">
                For my studio what direction am I suppose to head towards to? Because right now Conditional Design is very broad. Am I suppose to think of what to create or follow what has already exsisted?

                <div class="a">
                ...because what you saw was looking at other poeple go through it e.g. Fungus Series, what if you create your own just to get a sense of what it was like rather than from second hand or third hand account right? You'll have a first hand expirence of it and that could be it.<br><br>
                Maybe this might help everyone else as well alot of times I recall the conversations I have with many of you during presentations, the feedback I have for your presentations I talk alot of <mark>collating exsisting examples of what you are doing. Take a specific attempt to look at it, filter out. So for e.g. you're looking at some of their methods you can start dissecting their methods lor. Some methods have more people, some methods use tools that are different from people and then think about wheater is it a similar track for all of them, like how loose where the conditions, how restrictive were they. And then think of the experience also, if you were to study some of these case studies that they have done: what did the participants do, how many of them broke the law, how many of them tried something different and how did that change the result?</mark>

                From what I understand, for my studio, I need to gather the existing ways that CD team has done and try it out for myself and friends. While for my studio I felt that I did not read enough and needed an angle to look at. I would start at where Stanley adviced on.

                    What do you mean by effective way? Is there a formula, does it take into account different cultural differences and biases? What is the main benefit of computational thinking if it is just applying a formula. It is similar to swiss style where it works for everything but there is also criticism being said for it. So is there any similar criticism that comes across for it? I'm interested to know how you apply it to Singapore context like HDB.</div><br><br>

I also ask Johnson to show my his CPJ from last semester and note down what I needed to read. I'm thankful Stanley did this so we can help each other out especially when one is lost. They are all very helpfully.

                    <h1>Visual Survey</h1>
                    For my visual research I did not really understand what I was required to bring to the class table hence I just did like a progression check in kind of presentation. As I was doing, I got more confused and had to take a step back. I decided to do a mindmap as everything seems a blur even the subject for my dissertation. After doing so it helps to clear my thoughts and better see what fits, what does not.<br><br>

                    Participatory design is a creative approach to engaging and co-creating with communities to address issues. While conditional design is an ever-changing tool for design emphasising humans interactions with advancing media and technology in social context.<br><br>

                    Participatory design is adhering to core principles, designing a suitable process, and applying the right tools and methods. And conditional design is focus on process is the product, logic is the tool and input come from external and complex environment.<br><br>

                    This image is a great starting point for me to work smart. Since last semster I get to read Victor Papanek's papers, I plan to just read two more other key thinkers readings. 
                    Johnson recommended The Reflective Practioner and IDEO, so I'll just start from there.

                    So you have a images or models of thinking can starting grouping them and then create like a folder on your computer to sort all of them out. Then you can... remember when you group images, you can sort images you can annotate them, you must annotate them. Because sometimes what mean a lot to you like maybe this expirence with the workshop means a lot toy you right now — three months later when you revisit the workshop "I don't know what happen eh, it was a fun experience."<br><br>
                    The other thing that you can document which you already kind of have started a little from your compendium right is project that go in line with your Conditional Design what they have done. Start to sort them by categories e.g. enviorment: onsite, technology mediated enviroments, tools: (that are commonly used in CD). Mostly tools with images with annotations.<br><br>
                    So what you do for them is building a library of tools, methods, etc. This is important especially for this group because everything you all are doing in this group has to do with models of thinking, tools and process. So you have to find ways to sort your images by that.

                    <img src="contents/dollar.png"  width="auto" height="15"> I was confused why Stanley never commented on anything regarding my dissertation direction. Kin Lin gave a suggestion of naming my title as Future Resistant since I came out with the nonsense term which I thought was a good idea. So I though, "Ah! This is where my disseration will head to! The uncertain future of CD," guess I was wrong (To be continued in next section). But with the given advice, I need to faster start sorting out exsisting works of Conditional Design with intense file sorting system.

                    I went ahead and create <a href="https://www.are.na/jodi-choo/visual-survey"target="_blank">my visual survery</a> using Are.na as recommended but didn't like it. I have to admit the  500 blocks limit definitely contributed to the pressure, LOL! I spend most of my time thinking very hard if this is the image i confirm plus chop want. This is how Are.na is playing mind games with me. Looking back, I realised last semster the coding lect made us do a collective website exercise. So I kinda took the template and decided to work my way around it.<br><br>
                    Update: After 3 hours of trying, Chorme don't seem to be able to fetch JSON file. So to not waste any precious time, I did it in glitch. Though its damn slow, as long as it can work I'll just have to make do.

                    Some parts are still unclear what the main focus of the paper will be are the 4 points seem to point towards 4 different directions:<br><br>
                    &#10122; <l>‘New ways of thinking’</l><br>We also need to remind ourselves that Conditional Design is new to some of us, but for it’s practitioners, they are not. Unless you are thinking of viewing it from ‘our’ view point, i.e. Singapore design?

                    &#10123; <l>‘Computation vs design thinking’</l><br>Compared to the other 3, this one has the clearest sense of how it may develop into a research paper. Even with the framing of the sentence of one way of thinking versus another, you can suggesting a <mark>comparative study</mark>; which is definitely possible for a paper. The question we want to ask ourselves is <mark>'why do this comparison'? It may be because you have identified some issues with design thinking, as the dominant way of thinking in design in Singapore, led by the <a href="https://www.designsingapore.org/"target="_blank">DesignSingapore</a> no less. You can argue what mentalities and ‘spirit’ design thinking nurtures in design who practice it or believe in it. And if you identify that as a problem, then you may suggest that conditional design can be a way to counteract on some of these negative ways of thinking/operating.</mark> Toby’s point on ‘designedly vs design thinking’ is a possible clue.  I will share with you my slides/thoughts on design thinking from BA2. I saw a lot of connections between my thoughts and also those of Rosner’s in ‘Critical Fabulations’, I will share that with you too.<br><br>
                    &#10124; <l>‘Participatory vs participatory design’</l><br>This is also framed as a comparative study, although it is unclear what you mean by ‘participatory’ and ‘participatory design’. For the latter, are you referring to different frameworks of engaging with users/audiences in a process of design? If so, how do you see conditional design operating different here? In the previous point, what worked was that there could be a point to make that certain dominant ways of thinking are not ideally so similarly, for this comparison to make a stronger point, you need to be able to identify what the issue is with ‘participatory design’.<br><br><div class="b">
                    Update: coming back here after the studio discussion. You were referring to ‘participatory design’ in the way that agencies like Participate in Design has operated. And you see that Conditional Design treats participation differently from them. But we also need to remember that they type of what they produce are also different. That’s not to say that we can’t draw from Conditional Design to question how else can we involve the users in our processes. Think of it in types of involvement: Participatory Design (Co-creation; co-ideation) -> Conditional Design (Co-design) perhaps?</div><br><br>
                    &#10125; <l>‘Obsolescence’</l><br>This one is by far the least clear? Not entirely sure what the main thrust of the argument will be.<br><br><div class="b">
                    Update: coming back after studio discussion. You were referring to how the founders of Conditional Design have mentioned that they way they operate will have to change soon. Perhaps there is something there to question what it can change to be. The only issue I have is that, in Singapore or in most of our practices, we are already not adopting ways of conditional design thinking and to jump from not adopting to wanting to change it seems like jumping the gun.

But I understand where he is coming from and I have to rethink about everything. For starters, I thought that my dissertation would have enough word count to cover all above mentioned. I still can't believe in myself to be able to vomit that many words so for Stanley to say there is four directions when all along I thought I just have one direction. After thinking about what Stanley said, I give it a thought that I should just follow what he says since he can "predict" my outcome. But was rather reluctant because I need a reason, don't wanna do it just cause he ask me to. I need to quickly choose which directions I'm keen on in order to perfom magic (show my RPO draft) on next Tuesday. <i>*lowkey panicking</i><br>

                I think that you have organised your readings in a very logical manner that will be easy to reference in the future. The list helps you to have an overall view of all readings you have accumulated so far, while the individual annotations saves time for future reference. 
                I think the part where you noted down key-words and the explanations of the key-words is very beneficial.

                Since our topics are quite different, I could understand your research interest specifically because of the pointers that you have made and the definition of certain terminologies such as computational thinking, a concept I’m totally unfamiliar or unaware of. 
                The issues that you’re touching upon are very well explained, giving the reader the context of what you’re going to do. For example. The section where you’ve mentioned social effects of technology,

                Your readings present a very clear flow of how Conditional Design is developed, why it should be implemented and existing comparisons with other fields of design. The titles helped in the categorisation or flow as well, and I appreciate the breakdown of some of the terminology used.

                Similarly to my comment for Jodi, I think I’d have a bit trouble in understanding the contents of your research, simply because of how our realms of research are different. However, the way you structured your readings have enabled me to understand your flow of thought in correlation with the readings that you have done, and the pointers were useful to understand what was considered important in each of them. To add, I think the mind map does really help to visualise that train of thought, since your research topic seem to engage with many terms, concepts, and ideas.

So this clearly shows how the template that I choose isn't suited for my contents.

                <!-- <img src="contents/dollar.png"  width="auto" height="15"> While I was researching about the  educational systems taught in Singapore and Singapore itself in general, I realised there is a self-defeated mindset Singaporean have; giving up without trying ("<i>Aiya</i>, what to do? Suck it up <i>lor</i>"), doing as per told without any questions (<i>man mode</i>), "as long as it works, nobody cares", etc. This negative mindset manifest into our actions affecting the way we lives. Then aren’t we just going through where ever the wind blows. Even now, my conformist mind does not question the way of things, I just do. Whenever I try to look at it deeper into e.g. social issues, it will circle back to nothing-I-can-do-about-it mentality. And honestly I feel frustrated at myself, yet another me has hopes; surely, there is a way.<br><br>
                This year marks the 8th year since I've been exposed to design education. I myself question what I've learn so far as a design student. During my two year course in Visual Communication (ITE), we are taught mainly on technical skills and the basics of design (design principles, rules of third, etc.) little to none on the "thinking" part of design. Each of us were marked on how great we can visually fluff artworks up or how well we manage to adapt doing exactly the way teachers wanted it to be. In my FYP project, I got a whopping GPA 4, feeling proud of my achievements along with encouraging push from my teachers asking me to try applying for an intern. And I did, but that is where shit got real.<br><br>

                I realise majority of Moniker's commercialise works are not adopting the ways of Conditional Design but yet still practice what they preach every Thursdays. The gist of the whole methodology—my own words: creates systems for solutions and those systems without a doubt takes time to be developed. But to put it into perspective, it does not seem practical in commercial sense. Design briefs are constantly shot like rapid wild fire and demands for expectations to be met with short given amount of time. Suddenly, Conditional Design seem to be useless. My brain asked, "What is the use of learning about it when I won't be using it in the working world?" What I'm trying to say is that in Singapore's stellar education system comes rigidity and narrow thinking. Just to clarify, this is not a rant but a self-reflection written at over 3am. Despite attending design schools in Singapore, it is challenging to unlearn years of rigid input. This is why I was so intrigue by Conditional Design, it is how we challenge the system despite given rules. I felt that similarly to Singapore, instead of flipping innocent tables it opens minds to see a wider horizon of thinking in many ways. We should not be satisfied with just a "solution" but to question how many other variable that has yet to be discovered.<br><br>
                As fellow design students or designers-to-be, we love to be in control; more control the more better. 
                It is an uncontrollable methodology 

                <br><br>







                a form of resistance.

                Then aren’t we just getting through the notion of 
                doing rather than knowing.

                <br><br>
                But when Moniker's framework is developed it is often used repeatedly. 
                liberating

                this method of approaching problems are often done by scientist (designerly thinking) rather than designers (Cross 223)

                ...But then you need to find out your own area of where this will be applied to; this can be applied to education, be applied on to a group of designers who are interested in pushing their ideas so it does not becomes too stale? Or working in a commercial enviroment also drains you? because you are taught to think for value rather than for quality of ideas. So what it does is that it can drain your creativity as a designer sometimes.<br><br>
                Condition Design fits a way of thinking that is more internal. That is why I understand why they have Moniker as a studio or agency that does does work but they have a sub team that does this practice. In this way they can keep their ideas constantly kee their ideas freah. But you definitely see it happening in education, maybe it is something that you want to pursue for your studio project wise. Then you can relate it to your own expirence as a student, perfectly fine for a project to be introspective. In other words you are questioning how your own education is like, what could have added value. There have been a legacy of seniors particularly in my (techne) class, they challenge what in means to learn in design. Last year we have a project; questioning whether there would be an anatomy in learning that is not dictated by a school or by a lecturer. Previous years, we had students doing type workshops, so he adopted a swiss type methodology, because he felt that his own type education in Singapore is not as indept. He wanted to try something that why he runs workshops.<br><br>
                So that when you want to find who you are speaking to, what can you learn from there? So the next time I felt that may be interesting is to be more strategic with the way you categoriesing the way they do thing: by tools, methods, etc. Which you already started to do already. And see if that gives you ideas to try out things for second semester...<br><br>
                ...You are trying to convince as why Conditional Design is good and you become a small subject expert in that area. So you are like putting together an expirence for us to understand, who does Conditional Design, what is the value of Conditional Design, how do you do Conditional Design, what are the methodologies behind it, interesting things can come out from it. And why is it good for us, what is it resisting? Is it resisting a very pragmatic view of design? Is it resisting a very utilitarian look of design? Is it resisting a way of design thinking that only champions products that can be sold that can solve problems, etc. That is a design of outcomes that you can design: expirence, a catalogue of CD projects, mindmap, through CD also can. So how can you be creative?<br><br>
                Who would you like to involve this project with? Design students, design professionals, you might want to start you own CD club in Singapore? So you want to understand what are the current challenges that they faced in design? So you can go deeper to question: e.g. its for LaSalle students only, then you want to do like an analysis: how is design taught in LaSalle in year 1, 2 & 3? And do you think CD can offer something different? Or can unlearn some of the bad habits? Or try to provide an alternative is not good? Singapore system is rather condensed as compared to overseas where they have a 4 year course that why we can't really go indepth. I personally challenge students: you think that theres something you want to do for yourself, for your juniors, for design education in general just do it. But you need to identify why is it worth doing (learning worth, being exposed to different ways of thinking)...<br><br>
                ...Mindmap keywords: control, restrain, parameters, etc. Find visual imagery to communicate that, thinking visually. Maybe you project is about teaching people to release control and why. So what I'm trying to say is not all images I'm trying to collect goes inside la, some.

Which requires me to manually drag and sort it everytime and might even accidentally drop into other classmate's columns. To solve this, since I already name my gif files in numbers, I just upload content backwards. In doing so, I saves time not needing to rearrange it one by one.

                Apparently using a whisk makes it easier to spin the water. Note to self: Spin, but don't give a washing machine wash LOL. It will disrupt the whites from warpping around the york. If the water slow down, do not ‘re-spin' again.<br><br>I tried leaving the cover on and low-heat for 3mins. I can see bubbles forming at the base of the pot, I guess you could call it a hotpot. I need always watch the base of the pot, too much bubbles means it needs to cool off first before proceeding with the task. And also, to use a cover depends on the temperature of the water will have to gauge yourself.<br><br>

                This is my second attempt. I am too lazy to wash the pot hoping the remains can add more volume to my current egg. By dunking the egg in the water slowed down the spin. Without thinking, I spin it as much as I could without touching the egg in the middle. And when taken out, the yolk and whites are barely intact. Its life is hanging by a thin thread. Ice bath really helps especially when i need time to position my camera for documentation. But I've also notice that the egg yolk will change its colour during this process.

                - If there is a second attempt, try washing the pot. I wonder if theres a difference or a factor that made my whites not wrapping on my yolk.

                This clearly shows my water is too hot, after this video I lower the fire. I referred to my day one attempt and thought maybe covering the cap might be why it was shape nicer? I don't know just wondering. So i tried the exact same usual steps, but with the cover on. I left it in for 2mins in case it gets overcooked and as expected it is. As I already messed up at the first step, my yolk broke. Out of desperation, i tried to shape the egg by cooking it in a ladle for the last min. But it still did not take the rounded shape as expected. Also, without vinegar, the whites are disperse.<br><br>

                The amount of bubbles appear more than desired but i still stir and dunk the egg in anyways. In order to compensate the heat, I cook it for 2mins instead of 3mins which went well. Speed of tornado is reduced and egg has been dropped gently at nearer proximity. Instead of using a whisk, i went back to my huge spoon from day 1 and spin the water more gently this time. Dropping down the egg from a closer proximity into the water. By reducing the spinning speed definitely helps to keep the egg intact together without dispersing. The bubbling on the sides helps to smoothen the texture on the egg whites  even if it was not successfully wrapped around the yolk.<br><br>

                <l>1. Workshops for Online Platforms</l><br>
                I plan to do a workshop which can be accessed for free by anyone that has Internet connectivity. At the same time I'm not a coder, so finding an existing platform would be ideal. Specifically real-time platforms or else it would defeat the purpose of collaboration in the first place.<br><br>
                For starters, I have to check out the what are the parameters of the found online platforms that I have gathered. This is important because different platforms with different devices has different limitations and that might cease the framework from happening.<br><br>
                After exploring respective platform's parameters I would then create a framework that is suited for online. Because I tried doing the Knot workshop with my friends once and realise that it doesn't work the same way: physical and digital.<br><br>

                There was one workshop that Luna did with a school that was interesting as it uses typography. Creating a framework that is especially designed for design students to better help their understanding in computational thinking would be something more relatable.<br><br>

                I've noticed that in CD's workbook, they added images inside. But I wonder what happens if there is no imagery but using just type and simplified conditions. Would participants get confused?<br><br>

                Because as I was trying myself by just reading the conditions itself it is hard for my to picture or know if what I'm doing is 'right or wrong'. And if I'm not doing it right (without looking) does it mean the conditions are too complicated?<br><br>

                Is not a problem I have with the word, its just a kind of interest la. You say its a supplement into education, umm and I feel more than supplementary it feels more like a foundation. So I think there is a huge difference between something that is foundational and something that is supplementary. So e.g. Supplementary: I imagine you guys are studying coding then at the same time doing CD. So a knowledge is very different from the one you learn from the one you learn CD first then you go into coding. So for that bit, so I think that bit which one do you think its happening?

                I think I was trying to refer to foundation.

                Ok, so then that gives a bigger problem for me. If its foundational, then your context is in higher learning but then I have nephews that are learning coding now at primary school, I think Yasser's son is learning coding too. So how do you..?
                </div><br><br>

                <img src="contents/speech.png"  width="auto" height="15"> Me:<br><br><div class="a">
                So I got mention that if primary schools are learning coding already why design education in higher learning are not taught yet. Students should learn about computational thinking first before being introduced to coding...
                </div><br><br>

                <img src="contents/speech.png"  width="auto" height="15"> GW:<br><br><div class="a">
                Then you can learn everything else that follows in design schools... Ok. Because one of the thing that I find interesting about your research for your RPO was your emphasis on digital literacy. Which is a huge thing going forward for everyone not just local but global. So digital literacy seems to be a big thing in educational circles and I mean I remember talking to Vikas about this as well where we as lecturers in higher learning are struggling with the lack of digital literacy that we fell sometimes should have been pre-done before they have enter higher education so there comes that kind of tension. So you are in a position where its foundational, but you don't want it to be foundational for primary school instead you want it to be for higher learning. Ok, why?

                <img src="contents/speech.png"  width="auto" height="15"> Me:<br><br><div class="a">
                For example, we (me and my group mates) are the target audience, then we are too old to go back to primary school to learn coding.

                Well lets just say, that is hopeless for you all already. So then what your project will do is to help people who are coming up so meaning your generation: Alpha and Omegas right? So if thats the case then would it make more sense if you are helping them? Or do you still think it should be a... for me, I'm ok with both as long as it is <mark>convincing as to why it needs to be in higher learning. Is it because CD simply as a kind of process-driven project or system requires someone of mature mentality to appreciate its process.</mark> So if you teach it to a 6 year old but to them it is a fun drawing exercise but they won't understand the lesson. Or that the pedagogy itself is so robust that you don't have to understand the lesson you already embodied it. Does that make sense? 
                </div><br><br>

                <img src="contents/speech.png"  width="auto" height="15"> Me:<br><br><div class="a">
                Ya, also Yasser gave me comments about my RPO asking me what is my target audience is it diploma students or degree students because e.g. diploma is more vocational and stuff. These are all assumptions, I feel like am I suppose to interview both diploma and degree before I settle for one? 
                </div><br><br>

                <img src="contents/speech.png"  width="auto" height="15"> GW:<br><br><div class="a">
                Well it depends on your research right. Because CD as foundation for computational thinking is not exactly new, so what will make the project new is where you apply it. Which is why you notice all the lecturers will ask you the same question; who are you applying it on? <mark>If you tell me diploma which means that they are vocational studies, they have yet to mature to a point where they are looking at something critically. Then that will would for them, its more like a scaffolding for them. You are building foundations that can help in their other classes but that needs to start first in diploma right?</mark> Obviously, there will be people who view your work, (I would imagine) and ask why don't you do this for primary school students then you have to have an answer for that: why not? If its a good answer, I'm not saying that you have to make it up now. But I'm saying that you have to think about it. <mark>And maybe its just a matter that your project is just testing ideas now here, then if it is good enough, robust enough then it could be spread across then it can reason enough I feel.</mark> But I just feel like you need to say it on your own, means you need to believe it la.<br><br>Umm okay, so that is my main problem was that: digital literacy, why study in higher education when it can be introduced to people as young as 6 years old. That could be a problem or not, if you are able to talk about your objective why you want to introduce it in either BA(Hons) Level 1, BA without honors Level 1, Diploma...<br><br>
                <div class="c">Do you know the differences with and without honors? Generally speaking in higher education its only the top 10% of any cohort is given a chance to do an honors. So for you guys is direct honors. So technically in the eye of the industry, you are suppose to be the best of the best. Because you don't get to go to the honors programme only the top 10%.</div><br><br>...or Higher Diploma, Secondary, Primary, or kindergarten. Because I know some kindergarten teachers robotics. So what is interesting to me is when you are going to teach 6 year olds then I would tell you to go and study what 6 year olds are being taught right now. Because their classes have to be very creative in order to teach them visual thinking. Look at all the product that are coming out for children these days that are trying to help children understand robotics/coding. There are a lot of innovate products that are being produced, do they in any way use CD? Most probably not,  so that means that there is a kind of maturity need for CD, so you need to be able to justify, at least for your Man. 2, justify who and why.

                So what we are missing right now is looking at students from BA1, so what I will love to know is the BA1's current knowledge. Just a kind of a means-testing of BA1, like you average test. Cause at least LASALLE a lot of our BA1s come from very different background, you have BA1 who are once programmers/architects. So it really depends on how you study them and how you bring out. And maybe look at BA1 from across schools that could be also something la. So that is also what is missing here.

                I want to ask if CD is helpful or if its interesting to them. E.g. Stanley mentioned that coding taught to computer science students can be very dry. Computer science students vs. design students learn coding very differently.
                </div><br><br>

                <img src="contents/speech.png"  width="auto" height="15"> GW:<br><br><div class="a">
                Ok, so is your argument for CD useful because it is interesting or is it useful because it actually functions to develop a way of thinking. 
                </div><br><br>

                <img src="contents/speech.png"  width="auto" height="15"> Me:<br><br><div class="a">
                Oh but my RPO I listed though...

                Oh no, thats fine thats good. So that means one of the value means that it is an interesting way or an engaging way to learn something that is very... is almost like a paradigm shift of thinking.<br><br>Ok, I mean it remains to be seen in what kinds of information to get out of the students la. But if you can get it, my next question to ask is how are you going to show it lor? Its the same question for everyone, I would imagine that these 3 (Understand CD, Key Influencers & History of Computation) are sort of found knowledge, this (context of project) gives you an understanding of academic approaches, this (case studies) gives you existing case studies in school. Ok cool, I want to find out at what level are these projects done. So ok, then will you be doing it linearly?

                <img src="contents/speech.png"  width="auto" height="15"> Me:<br><br><div class="a">
                I plan to do on a website that will hold my information. And for the case studies would be the examples of offical Conditional Design workshops that is held in schools in Netherlands. They asked students to create framework themselves which is interesting.

                <img src="contents/speech.png"  width="auto" height="15"> GW:<br><br><div class="a">
                Ok but what is the purpose of it applied to schools... It will be a totally different project if for e.g. introducing to BA1 as alternative drawings vs computational thinking. So the framing is different so I'll be interested in what they are doing.<br><br>Shan Yang is one of our main information graphics designer in Singapore, in fact one of the only ones, I think he has monopoly's of projects from big companies like Singtel and all that. But hes quite brilliant you can do research on him. Umm, so he taught in LASALLE before, hes taught BA2 computational thinking so maybe if you can, try and talk to him.<br><br>So find out what they were after, the objective and then find out your students from BA1, justify the students as well... beyond that, I mean I haven't seen exactly what kind of information are taken from the students, but we will find out soon enough.

                <div class="c">
                    GW: Do you find your coding class in BA2 interesting?<br>

                    GW: Ok, what do you like the most about it?<br>

                    KL: That I can view the changes... [inaudible] I have the control... [inaudible]<br>

                    GW: Questions that I asked her are actually pointless cause it doesn't add to my understanding of problems in BA2. So the first thing that I'll ask her now that is useful is; If I were to ask you to create a website that has a ripple effect every time when you click, what is the first thing you need to do?<br>

                    KL: Am I suppose to create a button?... [inaudible] Or just like the mouse...  [inaudible]<br>

                    GW: Ok, so you are asking me if theres a button or its just mouse. So lets just say this is a question she returned to me. Ok, if its just a button what will you do? Lets say what program will you use? However you want.<br>

                    KL: I will use HTML and CSS cause like... [inaudible]<br>

                    GW: Do you have an idea of what it looks like?<br>

                    GW: Ok, then can you describe to me how you think the button works.<br>

                    KL: When you click it for now on the button maybe nothing would happen yet but I will have to find out how to make it work.

                Ok, so base on our discussion right what can we access on her capacity, her thinking. That there is certain builds that she thinks visually and that is very natural to her as a designer so all of us would think the same way but what she doesn't think about is the function of the visual.

                Yes, she dosen't think of it as a container, as a function so to speak. So that means that there are certain thing that are not in place for her which is why she might be struggling with it. So computational thinking is something that you can assess by questioning. But you cannot ask them whether anot its interesting to them because well not that you cannot, you can but you just need to understand that is not where you're gonna draw your information from.

                Definitely, which is why I say you can ask but don't rely on that. There needs to be something where you dig in where you can get it out of there.<br><br>So its the same with you guys if you are going to do interviews, you all need to ask questions that you think to answer  has actual function to whatever you want to do or trying to learn. Don't lead it but you have to ask more difficult questions. And try not to be the way I've been doing it which is like I'm being a bit antagonistic with her. So I mean you want to make the person feel at home, I was just trying to make a point.

                For my final I plan to create frameworks solely for online platform collaboration uses. Because times like this (Covid) where everyone have to keep a distance, it don't make sense to 'stop collaborating'.

                That is interesting, I like the ambition, umm and don't worry you can the less than half of next year to do it, where you can maybe gain coding confidence over the holidays then you can immediately explore then ok lets do that. The questions to ask if its digital, and you know its going to be applied in BA1, what difference does the digital platform brings to the CD workshop. I feel like it shouldn't be exactly the same. This is what sets you apart, you want to be able to say that ok I want bring it to digital platform, I made the interactions different because now people are able to directly connect the thinking of computational work to the thing they are doing right now. They are almost simultaneously see it. But lets push that aside to next year, I'm not so worried about it alright. I'm more worried how are you going to show this in your Man. 2.

                Ok-ok fair enough. Then after that you go down to 'Key Influences', 'History' or 'Case Studies'... your context is missing uh. So in a way I almost feel like this (contenxt of project) needs to be promoted uh. So it will give some kind of context to the project to them.<br><br>Ok, so you kindda know your structure, but well you need to work it out. At the moment it feels a bit vague, then tells me I don't know the user journey of the website. You have a lot of content so I'm not worried, but it is the structure; how we acess the content and through what lens are we accessing it through. E.g. I know CD, and I know the context in which you are working with it then I can access the 'Key Influences' through the lens of the 'Conext' which is education, then I can access the 'Case Studies through the lens of education. So all these things can more weight, more meaning to it. So then you think about how your website is going to function. Alright website then.<br><br>So it remains what it means to be seen from the insights of the students and visual language: what kind of visual solutions you have to individual snippets of information and what are the visual forms that you will be using.

                The formal qualities of the visual, as well as the—what kind of solutions you used for it. So a visual language would be e.g. you could be into brutalist aesthetics, so you remember in the 80s there is a lot of brutalist architecture. So lets just say you really like brutalist aesthetics but the philosophy of brutalist comes with it you cannot take it away. If not you are just reappropriating it. The application is towards a certain philosophy then you find that it is appropriate for your content so you use the brutalist aesthetics. Then I want to see how you take care of the forms, so what are the brutalist kinds of forms: repetition, tight quaters, right angles so the forms starts to come up. How you play with the forms becomes your skill as a designer. You want to be like a brutalist aesthetics but you are clumsy with the playing of the forms then it is another thing already. Or you are very eloquent, the way you use forms is very smart. You add your own spin to it, it is very tasteful and understands the this philosophy. Then that comes a very good grasps of the language. So when I ask you what is the visual language usually the way I do it, I have to understand my content first, then the content leads to what kind of language. There are certain cliches like CD comes from a long line of visual traditions starting with [this architectural school]... I will remember it and will get back to you but actually there is this school that has a progressive take on architecture and as a result the school's visual language takes on its own kind of new movement and everybody took from there henceforth. And CD took from there, that language. So the language is very tied into your work, its not arbitrary one ok? Ok cool.

                Kyla Arsadjaja is currently a freelancer who recently graduated from Yale School of Art: MFA in Graphic Design. Though I do not have a video of it, Kyla presented 'Developing Choreographies With Type and Motion Paths' video during the sharing seesion. While enabling camera access, random words of selected body parts will be moving across the screen and participants are to match the respective words with their own body parts. This concept is so refreshing developing choreographies of dance moves allowing non-dancers to participate just by following the "instructions".<br><br>After doing almost over a whole semester worth of Conditional Design helps me to identify this as a possible framework on how technology and people can come together partying. I can't help but to draw connection from Tibor's work for Restaurant Florent. Using typography to stimulate brains to imagine/visualise the details was a sophisticated yet mindblowing approach. It inspired me to use it as a starting point for Andreas's class (he requested us present to him our interest and will guide us from there).<br><br>

                <u>Coding Workshop II</u><br>
                After showing Andreas, he shared with me what he did last semster with my other classmates using PoseNet with p5.js. He added that it is not super accurate as it depends on the enviroment lighting it can get really noisy.<br><br>

                I had a quick chat with Andreas and he shared with me about the no-code movement. He shared that no-code movement does not mean there is totally no-code involved but to simplify code for people. In my head I just thinking is it like a Canva for Adobe Illustrator?

            <div class="breaker"></div><br>

                <img src="contents/dollar.png"  width="auto" height="15"> Honestly, I don't have anything much in mind to exactly do for Andreas class. I wanted to explore what I can do in this class and see if it could lead to a framework that I can further develop in my next semester fyp. I felt that I shouldn't limit myself by fixating on how my final outcome should be, after all this method is part of Conditional Design I would be contradicting myself.

                After much thought, I need to do quite a bit of survey layers. Each level: Diploma and Degree, and year: 1—4. Additionally, one survey for before Conditional Design workshop and another for those who participated after in order to see if my argument made sense.

                After several iterations and test runs, I worked out the following questions:

                        It seems that I need more time to properly thinking about what are my objectives and question by asking the specific questions what will I want to find out from them. It is something that I work think through during the semester break.

            <div class="single">
                    During this week I was going around in circles thinking that my project idea goes all the way back to week 1 with Stanley about collaborative. However, after talking to Guo Wen help me to clarify all disorganized thoughts flying around my head.

                <h1>Mandatory 2</h1>
                I've decided to apply my mandatory 2 on a website as it can hold many different file types. And by doing it from scratch forces me to improve on my proficiency on markup language. The website gather Influences from Swiss design as they are known for using system in their designs.<br><br>

                In order to show Guo Wen what I roughly had in mind, I did a one page code out. So at least he get a rough idea of where I was headed towards. His comments were that the alignment in my web menu was not align to my grid. And with that I asked Matthew from Year 2 hoping to seek help in the back end part but he told me that website usually have a 12 column grid. Something I didn't know about. And with that is already a great starting point for me.<br><br>

                In my Key Influences page, I've reduced the font size for all and added lines to better segregate components in the website. However, I seems like there is a lack of space for me to place my footnotes and references.

                So as seen, I added a fixed position column on the left side that would solve the issue I'm currently facing.<br><br>

                Toby was kind enough to share a Painter.js sketch with me that I find useful to interact with the user. Hopefully to engage them to try out the mini Conditional design workshop too. I wanted to change the colours into strings of "red, blue, green and black" but I couldn't figure out how to twig the js. So... I just stick to the multi-coloured lines.

                <u>Reflections</u><br>
                After consulting Andreas, he shared his opinions on how I've spend too much time on the back end rather then exploring other methods or ways to present my works in. It challenges me to think about the way I can approach my Man 3.<br><br>

                Also I've asked him teach me better ways to ease the back end of CPJ site to more efficient as experience its rather laggy. And as experienced 15 weeks of this site gave me notes on what to avoid in next semester. It is important to better plan out systems ahead otherwise it will be in my situation now. It is too late to make changes...<br><br>


                <div class="breaker"></div><br>


                <h1>Mandatory 3</h1>
                <div class="a">
                    <i>"When I started studying graphic design, I was frustrated by the software. As designers we all work with the same software, mainly Adobe applications. These applications solve the problem of graphic design well. That frustrates me. Standard tools lead us in specific directions, because they only offer certain possibilities. It seems strange that we accept the restrictions that companies offer us. If we accept a computer as a tool, it should be as a way of making our own tools."</i>
                </div><br><br>

                For my man 3, I read Jonathan Puckey's interview in Participate in Design book that shifts my perspective. It reminded me of the explorations of existing platforms I did few weeks ago to better its parameters. So I've decided to do my man 3 in Google Sheets.<br><br>


                <img src="https://imgur.com/r0ICjGV.png"  width="auto" height="500" style="padding-right: 10px;" class="photos"><br>
                It is so tough for me to get the visual out because I myself work rather rigidly and systematic. Without knowing I've been constantly creating repetitive patterns which contrast with Conditional Design (organic input). But eventually I selected a few, thank God.<br><br>
