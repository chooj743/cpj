                <div class="a">
                The start to the compendium jumps quite quickly into elaborating on computation thinking, and a couple of sentences to set the context would have aided a greater understanding of the reason for the study. The compendium was able to establish a purpose for the study of both LeWitt and Moniker’s work, guided by a question of whether operating with rules and conditions affects creativity adversely. Some statements in the writing can be better clarified, for example <mark>what you mean by computation in design being the basis of the study</mark> can be better addressed by first clarifying how do you see works of both parties as fitting with computation or related ways of thinking. At the moment, that is implied and could be better articulated in writing. The formatting of the case studies follows a structured flow. The comparison of both parties’ approaches are done fairly well editorially, highlighting the possible relationships between the two. You were able to relate the insights uncovered from the study to your own thinking as a designer. In discussing your thoughts for future directions, it is <mark>not necessary to already decide what specific mediums that your research will take the form of (in this case, a website) because that can limit where the research can take you</mark>. Instead, it should follow the area of inquiry (in this case, conditional design thinking) to allow the process of understanding and discovery to guide the project. The area of research offers opportunities for expansion into future inquiries.<br><br>

                Take note to edit and vet through your content: pg10 is a repeat of pg8’s content; sentences and passages can connect better with each other. In general, the layout for the compendium is well considered and the use of images and their composition in relation to each other has added value and meaning to the discussion of the case studies. You could further explore how else to sequence and arrange the images selected.

                    <h1>Random Ideas and Thoughts for FYP</h1>
                    During the holidays I was watching videos and reading article as I do not have a clue to what subject to focus on yet. So here is a very much casually written brief.<br><br>
                    <b>Subject 1 – Kids</b><br>
                    After watching <a href="https://casholman.com/"target="_blank">Cas Holman</a>: Design for Play on Netflix's, Abstract: The Art of Design she talked about how children do not like to be told what to do. Holman's toys are designed to work as a modular unit; able to grow and morph into what imagination brings. Upon hearing this, my brain draw connections from the whole 'instructional' thing. In both Sol LeWitt & Moniker's works it does not require a genius to be able to execute the works but rather the 'instructions' have to be clearly written in order to avoid misunderstandings.
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="b">
                        <l>Question/Thoughts</l>:<br>
                        <i>"Instructional means strictly working within the specific given instructions. Whereas, Conditional means working around within the limits of the given framework."</i> —pg iii of my Conditional Design Compendium<br>
                        If conditional is not instructional (and easy to understand) like how Luna <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7K50vlauwQ&t=4m42s" target="_blank">talked about</a>, children would be able to have fun.
                        <br>
                        <l>Target Audience</l>: Children range 6 to 12 years old
                        <br>
                        <l>Challenges</l>: Come out with tasks which are ideally understood by kids yet able to have fun.
                        <br>
                        <l>Significance</l>: Puts the whole theory for a test.
                    </div>
                    <br>

                    <b>Subject 2 – Real-Time Platform for Creatives</b><br>
                    At the last page of my compendium I wrote:<br>
                    <div class="a">
                    <i>"As designers, there are instances where one got a chance to work on collaborative projects with others. However, there seems to be a segregation between both. Instead of merging ideas into something new, many participants just did what they wanted and just blindly join ideas together. Are we really collaborating with each other?"</i>
                    </div>
                    After doing my research, I've <a href="https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/the-design-collaboration-platform-thats-gone-viral/"target="_blank">found</a> that there is an existing <a href="http://www.open-collab.org/"target="_blank">collaborative platform</a> for students done by Patrick Thomas.
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="b">
                        <l>Question/Thoughts</l>: Casual collaboration within creatives not practice often enough. It is usually done when job requires us to or schools called us to. 
                        <br>
                        <l>Target Audience</l>: Creative individuals
                        <br>
                        <l>Challenges</l>: Limited technical skills? LOL
                        <br>
                        <l>Significance</l>: Ideas tends to bounce of one another better than trying to work with only ourselves. All would benefit greatly off of each other and expand our creative thinking or problem solving skills.
                    </div>

                    <br><br>
                    <img src="contents/dollar.png"  width="auto" height="15"> I've decided to take a step back because my brain continues to run around in circles despite repeatedly banging onto the same wall. What is new for me is that tackling a brief with an exsisting problem seems easier but was something I did not want to blindly do. It is hard to think about a subject without imagining the outcome. Without knowing I find myself reading articles in all kinds of possible directions, I guess I am damn lost. So with what I've got, I just submitted my Subject 2 for my design brief deadline.

                    I've been following Song on social media for quite some time now but it is pretty hard to find information about her or her works (other than the short captions from her insta post).

                    Song's works always seem to challenge the boundries of given systems. Anti-user-friendly series (<a href="http://yhsong.com/inverted/01.html"target="_blank">#01</a>, <a href="http://yhsong.com/inverted/02.html"target="_blank">#02</a> & <a href="http://www.yhsong.com/detail.html#Anti_User_friendly_Match_my_four_fingers"target="_blank">Moblie App</a>) is one of my favorite works from Song countering the idea of rather than how interface should have been. She explained in a video that she was reading about how designers talked about having the "perfect" standardised interface almost like a do or die. But Song felt that if in doing so users repetitive behaviour would result in losing their content awareness.

                    <h1>Draft 01: Design Brief</h1>
                    <l>Design Statement</l><br>This project aims to promote community engagement within creative individuals around the world regardless of location or backgrounds.<br><br>

                    <l>Context of Project</l><br>Conditional design carries out a great use of linguistic communication towards their participants. These guidelines have to be simple and easy to understand and well written with logic. It is working around within the limits of the given framework. As fellow designers approach projects, algorithmic thinking would enhance problem solving skills and alter their perception towards countering risen issues. In this situation, the final outcome is barely significant but rather it is about the process during the making.
                    <br><br>
                    It is important to develop a framework in order to guide the process. Thus in other similar situations, the set of frameworks can still be applied. One could perceive working with rules and conditions destroys creativity, however is it really the case?
                    <br><br>

                    An idea with logic strengthens the concept and adds functionality purpose. Though logic is not absolutely necessary but would greatly benefit from it in the long term.
                    <br><br>

                    <l>Objective of Project</l><br>As designers, there are instances where one got a chance to work on collaborative projects with others. However, there seems to be a segregation between both. Instead of merging ideas into something new, many participants just did what they wanted and just blindly attach ideas together. Are we really collaborating with each other
                    <br><br>

                    Knowledge, methods and advice are meant to be shared and there is so much to learn from each other. Creatives tend to grow better by communicating or interacting with another creative.
                    <br><br>


                    <l>Significance of Project</l><br>One of the perks of the Internet is having the power to constantly change and update data being stored or shown to the public users. By creating an online platform creatives could exchange their creativity and knowledge with each other across the world.

                <div class="breaker"></div><br>

                    <img src="contents/speech.png"  width="auto" height="15"> Stanley comments on first draft of design brief:<br><br>

                    <div class="a">
                    &#10122; The brief details a clear focus of the research, i.e. conditional design, and it provides a good basis for further discussions with regard to the research on the topic can branch into.<br><br>

                    &#10123; At the moment, the design statement does not yet reveal how conditional design can play a role in promoting community engagement. Having said that, the design statement can be tricky to write at the start because it is seen as a distillation of the gist of your research into one statement. So don’t worry, we will get there through iterative revisions of it together.<br><br>

                    &#10124; Reading the ‘Context of Project’ section pulls up a number of terms that are worth a deeper look. Particularly ‘problem solving’, ‘process’, and ‘creativity’, although these terms are deeply connected in our vocabulary as designers, some scholars have gone on to elaborate on <mark>how ‘problem solving’ can sometimes be antithetical to ‘process’. Especially so when ‘problem-solving’ is approached from a deterministic view, i.e. when designers are posed with a problem, they immediately imagine what can solve it and just work towards that without considering other possibilities.</mark> So in this view, <mark>the ‘process’ is merely the ‘process’ of materialising the solution and not the expansive perspective of process that allows for discovery and flexible redirection of ideas.</mark> Rosner terms this view as solutionism, in her book, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/critical-fabulations"target="_blank">Critical Fabulation</a>. I took a photo of that page in the book; hopefully it is not too hard to read (see attached). Just to be clear, <mark>there is no problem with identifying or solving problems, but it’s the way we approach it that can be an issue.</mark><br><br>

                    &#10125; So it can be argued that in this linear view of ‘process’, ‘creativity’ is also hampered. Which perhaps can give reason to why you believe conditional design can realign our perspectives since <mark>conditional design does not ‘predict’ the outcome but requires us to follow a process.</mark><br><br>

                    &#10126; What I miss from the context is the point on promoting community engagement, which was mentioned in the design statement above it. The context section can be read from an individual designer’s point-of-view as opposed to a collective one. The need for collaboration is becoming necessary, especially so in our expanding networked environment. <mark>With more complex societal problems, it requires the solidarity of many coming together rather than the solo efforts alone, as the recent health and racial crisis has shown us too</mark>. But <mark>how can we nurture a more collaborative way of thinking that goes against outdated and oppressive dominant ideologies that tends to celebrate the single genius designer and create a hierarchy of power and competition?</mark> Perhaps conditional design can spark the thought that a person is seen as <mark>a part of a whole, and in doing so, it may allow us to nurture and rehabilitate us towards a more collaborative perspective.</mark><br><br>

                    &#10127; And this aligns really well with what you wrote for the ‘Objective of Project’ where it focuses on collaboration. So piecing what you wrote and thinking out loud here, your project could be experiments with conditional design, by <mark>developing frameworks (of thinking), tools of (making) and/or explorations (of work) through a collaborative environment</mark>. If so, the ‘Context of Project’ should include <mark>why collaboration is imperative for our times.</mark> But I think having the ‘around the world’ is potentially exciting but also daunting, perhaps you can start with small-scale experiments and explorations first that then are scalable in the future. And since the nature of the project is experimental, these small experiments can fail, then you document and communicate how and why they failed.<br><br>

                    &#10128; On the note of the importance of collaboration, <a href="https://sandberg.nl/anja-groten/staff" target="_blank">Anja Groten</a> from Sandberg Institute, said “…acknowledge that collaboration is not a choice. Collaboration as a condition acting and reacting at all times, and inhibiting power relations.” This is from her article, Towards A Critical Collaborative Practice, in the book <a href="https://www.valiz.nl/publicaties/design-dedication-adaptive-mentalities-in-design-education.html" target="_blank">Design Dedication</a>.<br><br>

                    &#10129; And to answer your question in the follow-up email, yes you can tweak the brief. It is always important to consider other possibilities (as some of my points above have alluded to, haha!) since one area of research can have different project trajectories. For example, you could build on conditional design’s approach to build generative systems for typographic systems (along the lines of some of the work of <a href="https://designobserver.com/feature/parametric-posters-from-muirmcneil/38520" target="_blank">MuirMcNeil</a>).</div>

                <l>Who</l><br>
                Back in 2008, the term was first introduced by <a href="https://eude.nl/" target="_blank">Edo Paulus</a>, <a href="https://www.jonathanpuckey.com/pages/about/" target="_blank">Jonathan Puckey</a>, <a href="https://www.xelor.nl/" target="_blank">Roel Wouters</a> and <a href="https://poly-luna.com/static/localhost_8888/luna/index.html" target="_blank">Luna Maurer</a>. It was during one of their <a href="https://conditionaldesign.org/index.html" target="_blank">weekly Tuesday night</a> sessions. They are constantly switching between each discipline and needed a term to define what they are doing. As a result, a <a href="https://conditionaldesign.org/manifesto/" target="_blank">Manifesto</a> was created by this group of four people.<br><br>
                Founded in 2012 by Luna Maurer and Jonathan Puckey, <a href="http://studiomoniker.com/" target="_blank">Studio Moniker</a> was formed. However due to Jonathan’s <a href="https://puckey.studio/" target="_blank">departure</a> in 2016, the studio is currently run by Luna Maurer and Roel Wouters. Moniker is an interactive design studio from Amsterdam constantly exploring the social effects of technology on how it influence us as humans.

                <br>You've heard of the famous saying "Think Outside the Box", but except it is the opposite of it: Think Within the Box! Conditional means working around within the limits of the given designed framework. This method focus on the process rather than the final outcome. <br><br>

                There is no specific conclusion of when the works are completed as Moniker's framework is highly dependent on the process of crowd's participation within the environment its being held at. In some cases, some works are online and it will end when it lacks visitors as it is expensive to keep it live. However, Moniker's ideas have no end and could be applied repeatedly on different occasions.

                <br>According to an <a href="https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/studio-moniker-digital-060520" target="_blank">interview</a> with Ruby Boddington, Luna explains that participation with Moniker is rather 'restricted'. Rather than self expression it is about answering questions or filling up a given blank space given by Moniker.

                As the exhibition ran its course, certain behaviour patterns start to surface. Everyone are always trying to find meaning as to where they position their stickers. It is impossible not to as the conditions requires participants so link it next to another. The graph above illustrate the pros and cons of the type of participants. There are some who found their way to work around the system creating more control for themselves Moniker calls them 'Hackers'.

                According to an <a href="https://equip.learning.com/computational-thinking-algorithmic-thinking-design-thinking" target="_blank">article</a> by Murphy:
                Design thinking's approach is user-centered, based on empathising why is this a problem. Its starts off on a specific problem and focues on finding a solution. However, computational thinking's approach uses algorithmic thinking that breaks down complex problems into systematically into steps. Driven by data, its methods are replicable and focues on the process over outcome.

                Moving on to controlling idea... As I was writing down my thoughts in the journal I noticed how ugly my handwriting was. I've always had difficulties signing my signatures as I couldn't get it to look consistent. It led me to think about how technology influence the way we write in the past few years. We write with our hand holding on to the pen on the paper. However, it shifted to mouse cursor on screen when computer softwares were created. Followed by the current "finger writing" commonly used on Instragram story canvas.<br><br>
                Additionally, I felt that fonts are dehumanised; created for a greater legibility and efficiency. Human's writing shows a lot about their personalities but is not always legible. In that case a letter stops looking like a letter itself (at what point does 'G' stops looking like a 'G')?

                <img src="contents/speech.png"  width="auto" height="15"> Stanley comments on my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GccnSH-XqEZNoYWQnWS7RYGVA_Dv3mNH/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">presentation slides</a>:<br><br>

                <div class="a">
                (start of voice recording)...thing and interaction with people. There are good things to it, some of you might remember I rant about design thinking in the past there are also bad things about it... alright? So thats where you can ah slip in "but Conditional Design does this..." then you can articulate where "<mark>How does Conditional Design maybe nurture a different way of building knowledge?</mark>" And besides naturing a different way of knowledge it also <mark>changes the way we think about design</mark>. Previously we talked about design thinking, as much as they say they work with people, speak with people, they treat people as information to be extracted from. All of us has done forms of design thinking: interview people, you get information from them, process it and then you do something about it. What <mark>Conditional Design does is that they treat people as part of the design process that means they actually contribute to the design process</mark>. It is not just listening to them and then you think about what you want to do about it. So that also <mark>changes about what you think is possible in design.</mark><br><br>
                This is a good segue to talk a little bit about differences between theory and practice for you dissertation and studio, this is for everyone ah. Although the project is tied quite closely, they are the same project actually. For dissertation you write about theoretical issues behind your project. So I can imagine for your dissertation <mark>you can write about how a practice of more critical practice of Conditional Design can challenge and overcome certain dominal ways of thinking that has been inculcated through design thinking. That will require you to first discuss what are the good and bad things about design thinking then you say Conditional Design into that.</mark><br><br>
                Then in your studio you don't have to do that because in theory you already argue why you do that. In studio you can just do experiments to challenge that lor. You want to try how many different ways you can include participants, how many different ways you can set conditions to design something different and then it just becomes a collection of a 100 or 200 (there can be 1 or 2 also if its on a large scale). Exercises that you want to explore because you are saying that other designers can draw from these experiments of yours even if there are mistakes it is fine. You can give people stickers they can do however they want to do with it. But its your attempt to get people to try it and also get designers to try it and then to record their thoughts about it; see whether is this the way they really look into design.<br><br>
                Another thing that I could share, in the line of art there is a operating that seems like a very early form of conditional design, atleast to me, although the conditions here are very loose, its called the Exquisite Corpse. It is a method of drawing for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=exquisite+corpse+drawing&sxsrf=ALeKk02uYkVc_ECJyUkAEriCwEg6_q9whg:1599986024742&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwibz5m13OXrAhUHb30KHQYYD-wQ_AUoAXoECBEQAw&biw=1440&bih=798" target="_blank">example</a>. You are <mark>reading off what the person has drawn before you and try to connect and sometime you would purposely want to disrupt it.</mark> It is a very early from of art making but you can do alot of different things now. Conditional Design doesn't have to be done through hand and it can be digital, it can be with your body, continue things from analog to a digital stage also possible.<br><br><br>

                For my studio what direction am I suppose to head towards to? Because right now Conditional Design is very broad. Am I suppose to think of what to create or follow what has already exsisted?

                ...because what you saw was looking at other poeple go through it e.g. Fungus Series, what if you create your own just to get a sense of what it was like rather than from second hand or third hand account right? You'll have a first hand expirence of it and that could be it.<br><br>
                Maybe this might help everyone else as well alot of times I recall the conversations I have with many of you during presentations, the feedback I have for your presentations I talk alot of <mark>collating exsisting examples of what you are doing. Take a specific attempt to look at it, filter out. So for e.g. you're looking at some of their methods you can start dissecting their methods lor. Some methods have more people, some methods use tools that are different from people and then think about wheater is it a similar track for all of them, like how loose where the conditions, how restrictive were they. And then think of the experience also, if you were to study some of these case studies that they have done: what did the participants do, how many of them broke the law, how many of them tried something different and how did that change the result?</mark>

                    What do you mean by effective way? Is there a formula, does it take into account different cultural differences and biases? What is the main benefit of computational thinking if it is just applying a formula. It is similar to swiss style where it works for everything but there is also criticism being said for it. So is there any similar criticism that comes across for it? I'm interested to know how you apply it to Singapore context like HDB.</div><br><br>

I also ask Johnson to show my his CPJ from last semester and note down what I needed to read. I'm thankful Stanley did this so we can help each other out especially when one is lost. They are all very helpfully.

                    <h1>Visual Survey</h1>
                    For my visual research I did not really understand what I was required to bring to the class table hence I just did like a progression check in kind of presentation. As I was doing, I got more confused and had to take a step back. I decided to do a mindmap as everything seems a blur even the subject for my dissertation. After doing so it helps to clear my thoughts and better see what fits, what does not.<br><br>

                    Participatory design is a creative approach to engaging and co-creating with communities to address issues. While conditional design is an ever-changing tool for design emphasising humans interactions with advancing media and technology in social context.<br><br>

                    Participatory design is adhering to core principles, designing a suitable process, and applying the right tools and methods. And conditional design is focus on process is the product, logic is the tool and input come from external and complex environment.<br><br>

                    This image is a great starting point for me to work smart. Since last semster I get to read Victor Papanek's papers, I plan to just read two more other key thinkers readings. 
                    Johnson recommended The Reflective Practioner and IDEO, so I'll just start from there.

                    So you have a images or models of thinking can starting grouping them and then create like a folder on your computer to sort all of them out. Then you can... remember when you group images, you can sort images you can annotate them, you must annotate them. Because sometimes what mean a lot to you like maybe this expirence with the workshop means a lot toy you right now — three months later when you revisit the workshop "I don't know what happen eh, it was a fun experience."<br><br>
                    The other thing that you can document which you already kind of have started a little from your compendium right is project that go in line with your Conditional Design what they have done. Start to sort them by categories e.g. enviorment: onsite, technology mediated enviroments, tools: (that are commonly used in CD). Mostly tools with images with annotations.<br><br>
                    So what you do for them is building a library of tools, methods, etc. This is important especially for this group because everything you all are doing in this group has to do with models of thinking, tools and process. So you have to find ways to sort your images by that.

                    <img src="contents/dollar.png"  width="auto" height="15"> I was confused why Stanley never commented on anything regarding my dissertation direction. Kin Lin gave a suggestion of naming my title as Future Resistant since I came out with the nonsense term which I thought was a good idea. So I though, "Ah! This is where my disseration will head to! The uncertain future of CD," guess I was wrong (To be continued in next section). But with the given advice, I need to faster start sorting out exsisting works of Conditional Design with intense file sorting system.

                    I went ahead and create <a href="https://www.are.na/jodi-choo/visual-survey"target="_blank">my visual survery</a> using Are.na as recommended but didn't like it. I have to admit the  500 blocks limit definitely contributed to the pressure, LOL! I spend most of my time thinking very hard if this is the image i confirm plus chop want. This is how Are.na is playing mind games with me. Looking back, I realised last semster the coding lect made us do a collective website exercise. So I kinda took the template and decided to work my way around it.<br><br>
                    Update: After 3 hours of trying, Chorme don't seem to be able to fetch JSON file. So to not waste any precious time, I did it in glitch. Though its damn slow, as long as it can work I'll just have to make do.

                    Some parts are still unclear what the main focus of the paper will be are the 4 points seem to point towards 4 different directions:<br><br>
                    &#10122; <l>‘New ways of thinking’</l><br>We also need to remind ourselves that Conditional Design is new to some of us, but for it’s practitioners, they are not. Unless you are thinking of viewing it from ‘our’ view point, i.e. Singapore design? If so, it may be possible to ask what do you think the ‘new’ conditional design framework offers to Singapore designers that we are currently not practicing?<br><br>
                    &#10123; <l>‘Computation vs design thinking’</l><br>Compared to the other 3, this one has the clearest sense of how it may develop into a research paper. Even with the framing of the sentence of one way of thinking versus another, you can suggesting a <mark>comparative study</mark>; which is definitely possible for a paper. The question we want to ask ourselves is <mark>'why do this comparison'? It may be because you have identified some issues with design thinking, as the dominant way of thinking in design in Singapore, led by the <a href="https://www.designsingapore.org/"target="_blank">DesignSingapore</a> no less. You can argue what mentalities and ‘spirit’ design thinking nurtures in design who practice it or believe in it. And if you identify that as a problem, then you may suggest that conditional design can be a way to counteract on some of these negative ways of thinking/operating.</mark> Toby’s point on ‘designedly vs design thinking’ is a possible clue.  I will share with you my slides/thoughts on design thinking from BA2. I saw a lot of connections between my thoughts and also those of Rosner’s in ‘Critical Fabulations’, I will share that with you too.<br><br>
                    &#10124; <l>‘Participatory vs participatory design’</l><br>This is also framed as a comparative study, although it is unclear what you mean by ‘participatory’ and ‘participatory design’. For the latter, are you referring to different frameworks of engaging with users/audiences in a process of design? If so, how do you see conditional design operating different here? In the previous point, what worked was that there could be a point to make that certain dominant ways of thinking are not ideally so similarly, for this comparison to make a stronger point, you need to be able to identify what the issue is with ‘participatory design’.<br><br><div class="b">
                    Update: coming back here after the studio discussion. You were referring to ‘participatory design’ in the way that agencies like Participate in Design has operated. And you see that Conditional Design treats participation differently from them. But we also need to remember that they type of what they produce are also different. That’s not to say that we can’t draw from Conditional Design to question how else can we involve the users in our processes. Think of it in types of involvement: Participatory Design (Co-creation; co-ideation) -> Conditional Design (Co-design) perhaps?</div><br><br>
                    &#10125; <l>‘Obsolescence’</l><br>This one is by far the least clear? Not entirely sure what the main thrust of the argument will be.<br><br><div class="b">
                    Update: coming back after studio discussion. You were referring to how the founders of Conditional Design have mentioned that they way they operate will have to change soon. Perhaps there is something there to question what it can change to be. The only issue I have is that, in Singapore or in most of our practices, we are already not adopting ways of conditional design thinking and to jump from not adopting to wanting to change it seems like jumping the gun.

                    <img src="contents/dollar.png"  width="auto" height="15"> Yeap, Stanley pulled me back to earth by saying, "jumping the gun." But I understand where he is coming from and I have to rethink about everything. For starters, I thought that my dissertation would have enough word count to cover all above mentioned. I still can't believe in myself to be able to vomit that many words so for Stanley to say there is four directions when all along I thought I just have one direction. After thinking about what Stanley said, I give it a thought that I should just follow what he says since he can "predict" my outcome. But was rather reluctant because I need a reason, don't wanna do it just cause he ask me to. I need to quickly choose which directions I'm keen on in order to perfom magic (show my RPO draft) on next Tuesday. <i>*lowkey panicking</i><br>

                I think that you have organised your readings in a very logical manner that will be easy to reference in the future. The list helps you to have an overall view of all readings you have accumulated so far, while the individual annotations saves time for future reference. 
                I think the part where you noted down key-words and the explanations of the key-words is very beneficial.

                Since our topics are quite different, I could understand your research interest specifically because of the pointers that you have made and the definition of certain terminologies such as computational thinking, a concept I’m totally unfamiliar or unaware of. 
                The issues that you’re touching upon are very well explained, giving the reader the context of what you’re going to do. For example. The section where you’ve mentioned social effects of technology,

                Your readings present a very clear flow of how Conditional Design is developed, why it should be implemented and existing comparisons with other fields of design. The titles helped in the categorisation or flow as well, and I appreciate the breakdown of some of the terminology used.

                Similarly to my comment for Jodi, I think I’d have a bit trouble in understanding the contents of your research, simply because of how our realms of research are different. However, the way you structured your readings have enabled me to understand your flow of thought in correlation with the readings that you have done, and the pointers were useful to understand what was considered important in each of them. To add, I think the mind map does really help to visualise that train of thought, since your research topic seem to engage with many terms, concepts, and ideas.

                <h1>Visual Survey</h1>
                For my visual research I did it on <a href="https://jodivs.glitch.me/" target="_blank">Glitch</a>.<br><br>

                <img src="contents/dollar.png"  width="auto" height="15"> While I was researching about the  educational systems taught in Singapore and Singapore itself in general, I realised there is a self-defeated mindset Singaporean have; giving up without trying ("<i>Aiya</i>, what to do? Suck it up <i>lor</i>"), doing as per told without any questions (<i>man mode</i>), "as long as it works, nobody cares", etc. This negative mindset manifest into our actions affecting the way we lives. Then aren’t we just going through where ever the wind blows. Even now, my conformist mind does not question the way of things, I just do. Whenever I try to look at it deeper into e.g. social issues, it will circle back to nothing-I-can-do-about-it mentality. And honestly I feel frustrated at myself, yet another me has hopes; surely, there is a way.<br><br>
                This year marks the 8th year since I've been exposed to design education. I myself question what I've learn so far as a design student. During my two year course in Visual Communication (ITE), we are taught mainly on technical skills and the basics of design (design principles, rules of third, etc.) little to none on the "thinking" part of design. Each of us were marked on how great we can visually fluff artworks up or how well we manage to adapt doing exactly the way teachers wanted it to be. In my FYP project, I got a whopping GPA 4, feeling proud of my achievements along with encouraging push from my teachers asking me to try applying for an intern. And I did, but that is where shit got real.<br><br>

                I realise majority of Moniker's commercialise works are not adopting the ways of Conditional Design but yet still practice what they preach every Thursdays. The gist of the whole methodology—my own words: creates systems for solutions and those systems without a doubt takes time to be developed. But to put it into perspective, it does not seem practical in commercial sense. Design briefs are constantly shot like rapid wild fire and demands for expectations to be met with short given amount of time. Suddenly, Conditional Design seem to be useless. My brain asked, "What is the use of learning about it when I won't be using it in the working world?" What I'm trying to say is that in Singapore's stellar education system comes rigidity and narrow thinking. Just to clarify, this is not a rant but a self-reflection written at over 3am. Despite attending design schools in Singapore, it is challenging to unlearn years of rigid input. This is why I was so intrigue by Conditional Design, it is how we challenge the system despite given rules. I felt that similarly to Singapore, instead of flipping innocent tables it opens minds to see a wider horizon of thinking in many ways. We should not be satisfied with just a "solution" but to question how many other variable that has yet to be discovered.<br><br>
                As fellow design students or designers-to-be, we love to be in control; more control the more better. 
                It is an uncontrollable methodology 

                <br><br>





                a form of resistance.

                Then aren’t we just getting through the notion of 
                doing rather than knowing.

                <br><br>
                But when Moniker's framework is developed it is often used repeatedly. 
                liberating

                this method of approaching problems are often done by scientist (designerly thinking) rather than designers (Cross 223)

                ...But then you need to find out your own area of where this will be applied to; this can be applied to education, be applied on to a group of designers who are interested in pushing their ideas so it does not becomes too stale? Or working in a commercial enviroment also drains you? because you are taught to think for value rather than for quality of ideas. So what it does is that it can drain your creativity as a designer sometimes.<br><br>
                Condition Design fits a way of thinking that is more internal. That is why I understand why they have Moniker as a studio or agency that does does work but they have a sub team that does this practice. In this way they can keep their ideas constantly kee their ideas freah. But you definitely see it happening in education, maybe it is something that you want to pursue for your studio project wise. Then you can relate it to your own expirence as a student, perfectly fine for a project to be introspective. In other words you are questioning how your own education is like, what could have added value. There have been a legacy of seniors particularly in my (techne) class, they challenge what in means to learn in design. Last year we have a project; questioning whether there would be an anatomy in learning that is not dictated by a school or by a lecturer. Previous years, we had students doing type workshops, so he adopted a swiss type methodology, because he felt that his own type education in Singapore is not as indept. He wanted to try something that why he runs workshops.<br><br>
                So that when you want to find who you are speaking to, what can you learn from there? So the next time I felt that may be interesting is to be more strategic with the way you categoriesing the way they do thing: by tools, methods, etc. Which you already started to do already. And see if that gives you ideas to try out things for second semester...<br><br>
                ...You are trying to convince as why Conditional Design is good and you become a small subject expert in that area. So you are like putting together an expirence for us to understand, who does Conditional Design, what is the value of Conditional Design, how do you do Conditional Design, what are the methodologies behind it, interesting things can come out from it. And why is it good for us, what is it resisting? Is it resisting a very pragmatic view of design? Is it resisting a very utilitarian look of design? Is it resisting a way of design thinking that only champions products that can be sold that can solve problems, etc. That is a design of outcomes that you can design: expirence, a catalogue of CD projects, mindmap, through CD also can. So how can you be creative?<br><br>
                Who would you like to involve this project with? Design students, design professionals, you might want to start you own CD club in Singapore? So you want to understand what are the current challenges that they faced in design? So you can go deeper to question: e.g. its for LaSalle students only, then you want to do like an analysis: how is design taught in LaSalle in year 1, 2 & 3? And do you think CD can offer something different? Or can unlearn some of the bad habits? Or try to provide an alternative is not good? Singapore system is rather condensed as compared to overseas where they have a 4 year course that why we can't really go indepth. I personally challenge students: you think that theres something you want to do for yourself, for your juniors, for design education in general just do it. But you need to identify why is it worth doing (learning worth, being exposed to different ways of thinking)...<br><br>
                ...Mindmap keywords: control, restrain, parameters, etc. Find visual imagery to communicate that, thinking visually. Maybe you project is about teaching people to release control and why. So what I'm trying to say is not all images I'm trying to collect goes inside la, some.

                After my first day posts, I decide to use egg/chicken related Gordan Ramsay reference in order to make Johnson hardwork paid off (he forces me to watch Gordan Ramsay but he's the one laughing to tears by himself). Additionally, I wanted to name my titles with as many egg puns as possible and needed to use the  <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/words-that-start-with-ex"target="_blank">dictionary</a> to draw inspiration from.<br><br>
                Since I want to sort by first showing the worksheet, followed by the first step, second step, etc. This may be abit slow to realise at day 4, but uploading content into Padlet auto sorts older content to the bottom. Which requires me to manually drag and sort it everytime and might even accidentally drop into other classmate's columns. To solve this, since I already name my gif files in numbers, I just upload content backwards. In doing so, I saves time not needing to rearrange it one by one.

She also did not say how long did she leave the egg in the pot for. According to the given instructions, I’m suppose to heat in the microwave for 3mins but i do not have so i skipped that part.

                Apparently using a whisk makes it easier to spin the water. Note to self: Spin, but don't give a washing machine wash LOL. It will disrupt the whites from warpping around the york. If the water slow down, do not ‘re-spin' again. <br><br>

                <br>
                I tried leaving the cover on and low-heat for 3mins. I can see bubbles forming at the base of the pot, I guess you could call it a hotpot. I need always watch the base of the pot, too much bubbles means it needs to cool off first before proceeding with the task. And also, to use a cover depends on the temperature of the water will have to gauge yourself.<br><br>

                This is my second attempt. I am too lazy to wash the pot hoping the remains can add more volume to my current egg.

                After dunking in the egg the water had slow down. Without thinking, I spin it as much as I could without touching the egg in the middle.<br><br>

                I realised I did not measure my water in the pot since day 1. I should create a chopstick template to measure inorder to keep it consistent. <br>

                <l>Questions That Surfaced</l><br>
                - how does the ‘perfect' temperature's bubbles at the base of the pot looks like so I can download in my brain.<br>
                - If there is a second attempt, try washing the pot. I wonder if theres a difference or a factor that made my whites not warpping on my yolk.

                Speed of tornado is reduced and egg has been dropped gently at nearer proximity. Instead of using a whisk, i went back to my huge spoon from day 1 and spin the water more gently this time. Dropping down the egg from a closer proximity into the water. By reducing the spinning speed definately helps to keep the egg intact together without dispersing.

                Using a jagged knife/saw (i don’t know what is that), does not cut through the sponge. In fact, it shows little to no effect. I've tried using penknife to cut but it gives unclean edges.<br><br>

                            I chance upon a converstation with Mathhew Lau sharing about my FYP regarding Conditional Design. He sent a <br><br>

                                Before this idea of Conditional Design (CD), they also took the idea from Karl Gerstner. At the junction when Gerstner came out, he was literally thinking about production wise, options, helping the designer to come out with all those ideas in a systematic way. He followed what back then e.g. computer, which is based on this matrix. So it is like a table with options in which you can select. But for CD, they go with the idea of conditions, in computation there is instruction (rules), conditions is related to instruction but instruction is very linear; e.g. 1,2,3 or A,B,C. With CD they focus on the conditions/conditionals/if then, it is like a map; e.g. one line leads to A, another line leads to B, from A can lead to C. Instructional is linear, Conditional is non-linear. CD heavily replies on the input, and hear the input is collaboration from the humans itself is what I find most interesting.<br><br>
