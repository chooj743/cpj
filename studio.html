                Stanley comments on first draft of design brief:<br><br>

                <div class="a">
                &#10122; The brief details a clear focus of the research, i.e. conditional design, and it provides a good basis for further discussions with regard to the research on the topic can branch into.<br><br>

                &#10123; At the moment, the design statement does not yet reveal how conditional design can play a role in promoting community engagement. Having said that, the design statement can be tricky to write at the start because it is seen as a distillation of the gist of your research into one statement. So don’t worry, we will get there through iterative revisions of it together.<br><br>

                &#10124; Reading the ‘Context of Project’ section pulls up a number of terms that are worth a deeper look. Particularly ‘problem solving’, ‘process’, and ‘creativity’, although these terms are deeply connected in our vocabulary as designers, some scholars have gone on to elaborate on how ‘problem solving’ can sometimes be antithetical to ‘process’. Especially so when ‘problem-solving’ is approached from a deterministic view, i.e. when designers are posed with a problem, they immediately imagine what can solve it and just work towards that without considering other possibilities. So in this view, the ‘process’ is merely the ‘process’ of materialising the solution and not the expansive perspective of process that allows for discovery and flexible redirection of ideas. Rosner terms this view as solutionism, in her book, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/critical-fabulations"target="_blank">Critical Fabulation</a>. I took a photo of that page in the book; hopefully it is not too hard to read (see attached). Just to be clear, there is no problem with identifying or solving problems, but it’s the way we approach it that can be an issue.<br><br>

                &#10125; So it can be argued that in this linear view of ‘process’, ‘creativity’ is also hampered. Which perhaps can give reason to why you believe conditional design can realign our perspectives since conditional design does not ‘predict’ the outcome but requires us to follow a process.<br><br>

                &#10126; What I miss from the context is the point on promoting community engagement, which was mentioned in the design statement above it. The context section can be read from an individual designer’s point-of-view as opposed to a collective one. The need for collaboration is becoming necessary, especially so in our expanding networked environment. With more complex societal problems, it requires the solidarity of many coming together rather than the solo efforts alone, as the recent health and racial crisis has shown us too. But how can we nurture a more collaborative way of thinking that goes against outdated and oppressive dominant ideologies that tends to celebrate the single genius designer and create a hierarchy of power and competition? Perhaps conditional design can spark the thought that a person is seen as a part of a whole, and in doing so, it may allow us to nurture and rehabilitate us towards a more collaborative perspective.<br><br>

                &#10127; And this aligns really well with what you wrote for the ‘Objective of Project’ where it focuses on collaboration. So piecing what you wrote and thinking out loud here, your project could be experiments with conditional design, by developing frameworks (of thinking), tools of (making) and/or explorations (of work) through a collaborative environment. If so, the ‘Context of Project’ should include why collaboration is imperative for our times. But I think having the ‘around the world’ is potentially exciting but also daunting, perhaps you can start with small-scale experiments and explorations first that then are scalable in the future. And since the nature of the project is experimental, these small experiments can fail, then you document and communicate how and why they failed.<br><br>

                &#10128; On the note of the importance of collaboration, <a href="https://sandberg.nl/anja-groten/staff" target="_blank">Anja Groten</a> from Sandberg Institute, said “…acknowledge that collaboration is not a choice. Collaboration as a condition acting and reacting at all times, and inhibiting power relations.” This is from her article, Towards A Critical Collaborative Practice, in the book <a href="https://www.valiz.nl/publicaties/design-dedication-adaptive-mentalities-in-design-education.html" target="_blank">Design Dedication</a>. I took some photos of the article to share with you (see attached).<br><br>

                &#10129; And to answer your question in the follow-up email, yes you can tweak the brief. It is always important to consider other possibilities (as some of my points above have alluded to, haha!) since one area of research can have different project trajectories. For example, you could build on conditional design’s approach to build generative systems for typographic systems (along the lines of some of the work of <a href="https://designobserver.com/feature/parametric-posters-from-muirmcneil/38520" target="_blank">MuirMcNeil</a>).
