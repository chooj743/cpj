                    <l>Conversation with Dhiya about Conditional Design</l><br>
                                I chance upon a converstation with Mathhew Lau sharing about my FYP regarding Conditional Design. He sent a <br><br>

                                    Before this idea of Conditional Design (CD), they also took the idea from Karl Gerstner. At the junction when Gerstner came out, he was literally thinking about production wise, options, helping the designer to come out with all those ideas in a systematic way. He followed what back then e.g. computer, which is based on this matrix. So it is like a table with options in which you can select. But for CD, they go with the idea of conditions, in computation there is instruction (rules), conditions is related to instruction but instruction is very linear; e.g. 1,2,3 or A,B,C. With CD they focus on the conditions/conditionals/if then, it is like a map; e.g. one line leads to A, another line leads to B, from A can lead to C. Instructional is linear, Conditional is non-linear. CD heavily replies on the input, and hear the input is collaboration from the humans itself is what I find most interesting.<br><br>

                                According to Dhiya, he shared with me that there is a difference between the conditions online and offline. So here I am, I'm gonna disect it out and do a comparison.<br><br>
