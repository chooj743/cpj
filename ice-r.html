                        <u>Title of Proposed Project</u><br>
                        Brand identity for an all-female fitness studio, Activ.Co<br><br>

                        <u>Design Statement</u><br>
                        This project aims to provide clarity in the company's personality and branding identity.<br><br>

                        <u>Context of Project</u><br>
                        Activ.Co is an all-female hybrid fitness fitness studio founded by Annisa Rahim, a female personal trainer based in Singapore. Annisa decided on opening a studio because she believes that there’s a lack of affordable, women-only studios in Singapore that provide a better gym experience for women to learn the basics of weight machines in gyms. Activ.Co has two studios, one located in the North, the neighbourhood of Sembawang and another in the East of Tampines.<br><br>Type of classes provided: Circuit 45 Level 1 & 2, AMRAP, Strong 45, Strong75, Boxfit, Mat Pilates, Sculpt, Align, Aroma Yoga, Hatha Yoga, Prenatal Pilates and Postnatal Pilates.<br><br>

                        <u>Target Audience</u><br>
                        Primary target audience: Female beginners, ladies who are nursing a sports injury and mothers and/or mothers to-be.<br><br>Secondary target audience: Female of all ages.<br><br>

                        <u>Objective of Project</u><br>
                        With a background in Sports and Wellness Management, Annisa hopes to educate people that female body anatomy is different from male’s. Therefore, the importance of creating a tailor made workout for female beginners. As a female trainer who isn’t a stranger to the weight rack, Annisa received alot of feedback from her female clients that many of them never tried out the machine in gyms as they felt too intimidated to go near it.<br><br>Apart from that, living in a multi-racial community and being a muslim, Annisa acknowledged that muslim women are often overlooked (Myriam) when it comes to looking for a female-only environment to workout in. Activ.Co hopes to empower women in the community by creating a safe environment for ladies to workout and educating them about the importance of instilling an active lifestyle with utmost confidence (White).<br><br>

                        <u>Significance of Project</u><br>
                        Since it first started in January 2019, Activ.Co has been working on building a consistent client base through word of mouth and social media. However, there wasn’t a consistency in their visual identity and tone of voice when they are promoting themselves.<br><br>Activ.Co aims to communicate with clarity and confidence ensuring visual consistency throughout the branding and online presence. Visuals must be able to convey services provided by Activ.Co without additional text needed as this would help attract larger online viewers.<br><br>

                        <u>Proposed Deliverables</u><br>
                        Brand Identity (revamping):<br>- Supergraphics<br>- Icon design<br><br>
                        Website: Revamp/Improve Webpage<br><br>

                        With that being said, despite having several distinctive qualities that sets Activ.Co apart from other competitors there seems to be an absence of brand personality. At the same time due to the nature of the brand name, it is barely noticeable for people who are interested to know if Activ.Co is an all-female fitness studio. As a consequence, Annisa introduced girlish graphics through the brand’s online platforms causing great visual disorder. Art direction throughout is inconsistent due to its frequent changes in style. Moreover, text was displayed in excessive amounts that would eventually overwhelm its viewers. This would mean possibly losing potential customers as well as financial profits.<br><br>Since its establishment, Annisa intended her all-female fitness studio to be a safe haven for females that will experience peace in their minds when working out (refer to context of project above). However, intentions were not well conveyed as it seems disconnected. Furthermore, customers who are interested in getting to know Activ.Co more are not able to due to a lack of information provided.
