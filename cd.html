                        The Conditional Design team created a manifesto that aims to alter their designers’ ways of working to correspond with the change in this technologically driven society (see fig. 3). With such specific purpose in mind, Conditional Design makes it appropriate for designers to embrace the change in environment due to the way its methodologies are developed. Their methodology consists of three main principles; process, logic and input. First and foremost, logic, it comes from the conditional designer using algorithmic thinking approach, only methods of “philosophers, engineers, inventors and mystics” (Maurer et al.).<br><br>They believe that conditions formulated with clarity and precision around an idea is necessary (Maurer et al.). In this way, the conditional designer is able to minimise possible issues that might surface during the process as well as to further guide the process.<br><br>Unlike design thinking which is outcome based, Conditional Design focused on the process itself (Stoduy and Maurer). Studio Moniker is an interactive design studio currently run by Luna Maurer and Roel Wouters which often practices Conditional Design approach commercially. In one of Studio Moniker’s projects called Fungus Series requires the participants to connect their given stickers onto another by its ends. This clearly shows that through a designed framework, it is nowhere near rigidity as the input is the participants themselves (see fig. 4) which would result in arbitrary outcomes (Boddington). This challenges participants to expand their creativity (see fig. 5) to think within the box, in which are written conditions. With this in mind, it shows how Conditional Design can introduce algorithmic thinking in a creative way that could help better understand digital literacy for design students who are interested. This activity encourages participants to think creatively while involving them in the making process as co-authors, this makes it clear that it is suitable for designers allowing them to see the relevance of learning computational thinking through condition design.

                    This method of approach are process-driven, creating precise frameworks that would affect their input (participants). How participants understands or react to the conditions creates arbitrary outcomes.

                    “There’s not really a moment when it’s done” (qtd. in Stosuy). There is no specific conclusion of when projects are completed as Moniker's frameworks are highly dependent on the process of crowd's participation within the environment its being held at. In some cases, where works are placed online and it will end when it lacks visitors as it is expensive to keep it live. However, Moniker's ideas have no end and could be applied repeatedly on different occasions.

                    According to Luna from Studio Moniker, the term "participation" is overused, commonly understood as a having authourity to contribute in the descision process. However, she adds that “We set the framework, and they join in the game. There are certain rules and they have to follow (or not follow) the rules. The space for personal expression is rather limited” (qtd. in Boddington).

                        Before this idea of Conditional Design (CD), they also took the idea from Karl Gerstner. At the junction when Gerstner came out, he was literally thinking about production wise, options, helping the designer to come out with all those ideas in a systematic way. He followed what back then e.g. computer, which is based on this matrix. So it is like a table with options in which you can select. But for CD, they go with the idea of conditions, in computation there is instruction (rules), conditions is related to instruction but instruction is very linear; e.g. 1,2,3 or A,B,C. With CD they focus on the conditions/conditionals/if then, it is like a map; e.g. one line leads to A, another line leads to B, from A can lead to C. Instructional is linear, Conditional is non-linear. CD heavily replies on the input, and hear the input is collaboration from the humans itself is what I find most interesting.<br><br>

                    According to Dhiya, he shared with me that there is a difference between the conditions online and offline. So here I am, I'm gonna disect it out and do a comparison.<br><br>
