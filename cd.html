                    <u>Education in Singapore</u><br>
                    Society is constantly evolving as digital technologies rapidly advances. Digital literacy helps the nation to stay relevant in an ever-increasingly digitised world and would greatly benefit Singapore’s economy (Lee). Mainstream education at the primary and secondary level have begun implementing coding programmes by Code for Fun, in 2014. By doing so, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and Ministry of Education (MOE) have made efforts to increase digital literacy and added a new value to learning code. Students who have undergone through these programmes have gained the ability to break down complex problems into manageable parts (Choo).<br><br>By 2025, Singapore’s design education aims to nurture future-ready designers (MCI 27) who are multidisciplinary and constantly work on improving their skill sets.This indicates the importance of educating design students on computational thinking in pursuit of digital literacy as a way for Singapore’s future generations to be future-proof.<br><br>According to the Design Education Review Committee (DERC) report from 2017, Singapore has highly recommended design institutions to adopt ways of design thinking(23). As visual learners, designers typically work on outcome based solutions, not considering the analytical approaches to problem solving (Sydney 6). This behaviour has led to a steeper learning curve when designers attempt to understand analytical based outcomes such as computer programming. Hence, this project seeks to better aid design students' learning experience by introducing alternative methods of problem solving; Conditional Design.

                        The Conditional Design team created a manifesto that aims to alter their designers’ ways of working to correspond with the change in this technologically driven society (see fig. 3). With such specific purpose in mind, Conditional Design makes it appropriate for designers to embrace the change in environment due to the way its methodologies are developed. Their methodology consists of three main principles; process, logic and input. First and foremost, logic, it comes from the conditional designer using algorithmic thinking approach, only methods of “philosophers, engineers, inventors and mystics” (Maurer et al.).<br><br>They believe that conditions formulated with clarity and precision around an idea is necessary (Maurer et al.). In this way, the conditional designer is able to minimise possible issues that might surface during the process as well as to further guide the process.<br><br>Unlike design thinking which is outcome based, Conditional Design focused on the process itself (Stoduy and Maurer). Studio Moniker is an interactive design studio currently run by Luna Maurer and Roel Wouters which often practices Conditional Design approach commercially. In one of Studio Moniker’s projects called Fungus Series requires the participants to connect their given stickers onto another by its ends. This clearly shows that through a designed framework, it is nowhere near rigidity as the input is the participants themselves (see fig. 4) which would result in arbitrary outcomes (Boddington). This challenges participants to expand their creativity (see fig. 5) to think within the box, in which are written conditions. With this in mind, it shows how Conditional Design can introduce algorithmic thinking in a creative way that could help better understand digital literacy for design students who are interested. This activity encourages participants to think creatively while involving them in the making process as co-authors, this makes it clear that it is suitable for designers allowing them to see the relevance of learning computational thinking through condition design.

                    This method of approach are process-driven, creating precise frameworks that would affect their input (participants). How participants understands or react to the conditions creates arbitrary outcomes.

                    “There’s not really a moment when it’s done” (qtd. in Stosuy). There is no specific conclusion of when projects are completed as Moniker's frameworks are highly dependent on the process of crowd's participation within the environment its being held at. In some cases, where works are placed online and it will end when it lacks visitors as it is expensive to keep it live. However, Moniker's ideas have no end and could be applied repeatedly on different occasions.

                    According to Luna from Studio Moniker, the term "participation" is overused, commonly understood as a having authourity to contribute in the descision process. However, she adds that “We set the framework, and they join in the game. There are certain rules and they have to follow (or not follow) the rules. The space for personal expression is rather limited” (qtd. in Boddington).

                            American-based conceptual artist Sol LeWitt is known for his instructional art (and design) practices. His drawings often use basic geometric shapes, lines and colours.<br><br>In ‘Sentences on Conceptual Art (1969)’, LeWitt wrote how an artist should not have a preconceived idea of how his art is going to turn out until its completion. Moreover, others may perceive given instructions differently; this subjectivity is not any better or worse from the artist itself.<br><br>LeWitt’s idea is his art. His drawings were executed by other draftsmen or artists who followed his instructions. This is made possible due to the precise logical instructions crafted by LeWitt himself.<br><br>Instructional means strictly working with the specific given instructions. For LeWitt, his method stimulates a rather mechanical process with no space for any iterations. Whereas, conditional means working around within the parameters of the given framework. Though there is little room for expression, the framework ensures sufficient room for surprising outcomes.

                            Karl Gerstner is a Swiss designer known for his systematic approach towards design solutions. Instead of designing for solutions, Gerstner developed a system for solutions (Gerstner et al. 9).<br><br>Gerstner claims that there is no definite solution to problems as there will always be certain solutions best suited within each particular condition.<br><br>Furthermore, creative decisions are not to be made based on mere feelings but by intellectual conditions. In this sense, it is an automation of designing through the creative process of selections and combinations.<br><br>Through applying these methods in the process, the designed solution is no longer appropriate to a particular solution but also the solutions to other forthcoming problems. This process allows the discovery for potential solutions will not be compromised (Gerstner et al. 9).

                        Before this idea of Conditional Design (CD), they also took the idea from Karl Gerstner. At the junction when Gerstner came out, he was literally thinking about production wise, options, helping the designer to come out with all those ideas in a systematic way. He followed what back then e.g. computer, which is based on this matrix. So it is like a table with options in which you can select. But for CD, they go with the idea of conditions, in computation there is instruction (rules), conditions is related to instruction but instruction is very linear; e.g. 1,2,3 or A,B,C. With CD they focus on the conditions/conditionals/if then, it is like a map; e.g. one line leads to A, another line leads to B, from A can lead to C. Instructional is linear, Conditional is non-linear. CD heavily replies on the input, and hear the input is collaboration from the humans itself is what I find most interesting.<br><br>
