                    <div class="a">Since the sub-title suggests that the paper will study the education of students, it will help to provide a brief context to how design education is like in Singapore first. <note>Because you suddenly start talking about design thinking and IDEO. In the subtitle you did not mention anything about design thinking and IDEO. So if you are thinking of bridging an arguement it feels like you went deep into the argument before doing the introduction. <br><br> Following that, after talking about what design education is like about how design education is commonly spilt into two in SG (even though theres MA) but commonly there is a diploma which is more vocationlly focused and BA that perhaps more research or exploratory. Then you can talk briefly about the different schools. Because if you go too deep about what every different school is doing that is too much. You can keep that for the 'Summary of Readings'.</note><br><br>
                    There is a point in the later parts of the 'Introduction' that touches on that; it can be moved ahead here. Following that, you can then discuss <mark>what happens in design education when processes or methodologies are taught that are aimed at highlighting the benefits of design to the economy alone</mark>, i.e. what are the resulting characteristics. <note>Thats when you can start talking about design thinking and say that Singapore has a main thrust to see design as part of supporting nation's economy. With that in mind, DSG has work with other colleges to rethink their curriculum; most curriculum teach a particular way or thinking, etc.</note> Be sure to note that there is a need for such a way of thinking, but it should not be the only approach to design. You can then end the 'introduction' section by highlighting that the paper aims to study how an approach based on conditional design can supplement design education to address some of these characteristics mentioned earlier. </div><br><br>


                    <l>Research Objective</l><br>
                    1. How design education is done in Singapore<br>
                    2. ‘designedly vs design’ vs computation thinking<br>
                    3. Conditional Design, New ways of thinking<br><br>

                    <div class="a">Not sure if there are options to consider? Or you would like to include all of them as the research objective.<br><br>Just to be clear, a dissertation should have one clear main objective, i.e. what do you hope it will accomplish? (Argue that conditional design as an approach to design can nurture a...?)<br><br>Following that, you can have sub-objectives. E.g. hope that design education in Singapore can adopt this approach, etc.<br><br>Part of the research objective will require you to discuss which specific audience will benefit from this paper.<br><br>Will need to write in prose for us to assess the clarity.</div><br><br>

                            On your third paragraph on "...by supplementing CD with...", is there an introduction prior to CD? I'm not saying that you should write an entire paragraph on it but I think you want to drop what are the attributes of CD that design thinking is missing. It can just be a one-liner prior to say... unless in the third paragraphy, you want to say what is the absolute value of putting CD. So at least there is some kind of idea before dropping this bomb.<br><br>Why DSC ah? Be very clear because they are not MOE, I understand that it is here. But you need to also indicate who they are, what are their jurisdiction. Because they are now given the authority to supervise or recommend or even intervene. Before that they don't play a big of a role but right now they do. Right now the role has changed, they are given a bit more authority, so I think you need to communicate one sentance with regards to that.<br><br>
                            <l>Objective</l><br>
                            I find that it is a little bit you did not explain how computational thinking and CD is related. There is a few steps that you are leap-frogging.<br><br>What is the one biggest attribute of CD that sets it apart from tradition ways? *he further explain this question by using Johnson as an example <i>Process driven, in which I put it at the Summary of Readings</i> Because for me its  the way you word it...? I think there is a need to communicate it somewhere without repeacting it or iterating it too. Another way of wording it is to e.g. Process Driven: is closely linked to CD then you just use the word 'Process Driven' la. Then below in your Summary of Readings you can talk about it in length.<br><br>

                            Design Education in Singapore:<br>
                            If there are other papers written about the Masterplan and is criticising it then it is fine to criticise. Because let's say out of 5 pieces of review, 3 says its shit, you need to put it down that there is criticism around. To me you can already plant this idea that design education in Singapore is not the most robust. You can just plant but don't drag it down and smear in mud; not as robust as it can be you know.<br><br>
                            Understanding Conditional Design:<br>
                            Roel Woulters... I work with him when I was in school. I did a workshop with him. Its the most fun workshop la. I'm friends with him on my socials and I got his email. Oh! You want to connect with him is it? Okok. His brother is also a very good calligrapher.<br><br>
                            
                            <l>Proposed Research Methodology</l><br>
                            Students:<br>
                            You need to plan, hypotesise, cause if you interview first, second or third year students you are going to get very different results. I think what you want to do also is to see if there are any experiments or workshops that is conducted by other designers to see how CD is being utilise by students who have not use CD before in order to see what kind of exsiting frameworks is being used. Because it is always better to rely on something that has been trial and tested and then adapt from it, if you can.<br><br>
                            Educators:<br>
                            So I'm just curious if you want to meet people from DSG ah? It is good to know if you think if CD is a must for our education system moving forward then you want to recommend. If the say its bullshit than "theres resistance from DSG". Because you need to understand where they are coming from, right now DSG is under EDB right? So that says alot out the shift in the direction how they want to position design in Singapore.<br><br>
                            <l>Overall</l><br>
                            I think right now it is a little bit messy. There are some areas where you leap frog, you just need to be very consistent; definitions, etc. But should be ok, start making the changes now la.
