                    <div class="a">Since the sub-title suggests that the paper will study the education of students, it will help to provide a brief context to how design education is like in Singapore first. <note>Because you suddenly start talking about design thinking and IDEO. In the subtitle you did not mention anything about design thinking and IDEO. So if you are thinking of bridging an arguement it feels like you went deep into the argument before doing the introduction. <br><br> Following that, after talking about what design education is like about how design education is commonly spilt into two in SG (even though theres MA) but commonly there is a diploma which is more vocationlly focused and BA that perhaps more research or exploratory. Then you can talk briefly about the different schools. Because if you go too deep about what every different school is doing that is too much. You can keep that for the 'Summary of Readings'.</note><br><br>
                    There is a point in the later parts of the 'Introduction' that touches on that; it can be moved ahead here. Following that, you can then discuss <mark>what happens in design education when processes or methodologies are taught that are aimed at highlighting the benefits of design to the economy alone</mark>, i.e. what are the resulting characteristics. <note>Thats when you can start talking about design thinking and say that Singapore has a main thrust to see design as part of supporting nation's economy. With that in mind, DSG has work with other colleges to rethink their curriculum; most curriculum teach a particular way or thinking, etc.</note> Be sure to note that there is a need for such a way of thinking, but it should not be the only approach to design. You can then end the 'introduction' section by highlighting that the paper aims to study how an approach based on conditional design can supplement design education to address some of these characteristics mentioned earlier. </div><br><br>


                    <l>Research Objective</l><br>
                    1. How design education is done in Singapore<br>
                    2. ‘designedly vs design’ vs computation thinking<br>
                    3. Conditional Design, New ways of thinking<br><br>

                    <div class="a">Not sure if there are options to consider? Or you would like to include all of them as the research objective.<br><br>Just to be clear, a dissertation should have one clear main objective, i.e. what do you hope it will accomplish? (Argue that conditional design as an approach to design can nurture a...?)<br><br>Following that, you can have sub-objectives. E.g. hope that design education in Singapore can adopt this approach, etc.<br><br>Part of the research objective will require you to discuss which specific audience will benefit from this paper.<br><br>Will need to write in prose for us to assess the clarity.</div><br><br>

                            On your third paragraph on "...by supplementing CD with...", is there an introduction prior to CD? I'm not saying that you should write an entire paragraph on it but I think you want to drop what are the attributes of CD that design thinking is missing. It can just be a one-liner prior to say... unless in the third paragraphy, you want to say what is the absolute value of putting CD. So at least there is some kind of idea before dropping this bomb.<br><br>Why DSC ah? Be very clear because they are not MOE, I understand that it is here. But you need to also indicate who they are, what are their jurisdiction. Because they are now given the authority to supervise or recommend or even intervene. Before that they don't play a big of a role but right now they do. Right now the role has changed, they are given a bit more authority, so I think you need to communicate one sentance with regards to that.<br><br>
                            <l>Objective</l><br>
                            I find that it is a little bit you did not explain how computational thinking and CD is related. There is a few steps that you are leap-frogging.<br><br>What is the one biggest attribute of CD that sets it apart from tradition ways? *he further explain this question by using Johnson as an example <i>Process driven, in which I put it at the Summary of Readings</i> Because for me its  the way you word it...? I think there is a need to communicate it somewhere without repeacting it or iterating it too. Another way of wording it is to e.g. Process Driven: is closely linked to CD then you just use the word 'Process Driven' la. Then below in your Summary of Readings you can talk about it in length.<br><br>

                            If there are other papers written about the Masterplan and is criticising it then it is fine to criticise. Because let's say out of 5 pieces of review, 3 says its shit, you need to put it down that there is criticism around. To me you can already plant this idea that design education in Singapore is not the most robust. You can just plant but don't drag it down and smear in mud; not as robust as it can be you know.<br><br>
                            Understanding Conditional Design:<br>
                            Roel Woulters... I work with him when I was in school. I did a workshop with him. Its the most fun workshop la. I'm friends with him on my socials and I got his email. Oh! You want to connect with him is it? Okok. His brother is also a very good calligrapher.<br><br>
                            
                            <l>Proposed Research Methodology</l><br>
                            Students:<br>
                            You need to plan, hypotesise, cause if you interview first, second or third year students you are going to get very different results. I think what you want to do also is to see if there are any experiments or workshops that is conducted by other designers to see how CD is being utilise by students who have not use CD before in order to see what kind of exsiting frameworks is being used. Because it is always better to rely on something that has been trial and tested and then adapt from it, if you can.<br><br>
                            Educators:<br>
                            So I'm just curious if you want to meet people from DSG ah? It is good to know if you think if CD is a must for our education system moving forward then you want to recommend. If the say its bullshit than "theres resistance from DSG". Because you need to understand where they are coming from, right now DSG is under EDB right? So that says alot out the shift in the direction how they want to position design in Singapore.<br><br>
                            <l>Overall</l><br>
                            I think right now it is a little bit messy. There are some areas where you leap frog, you just need to be very consistent; definitions, etc. But should be ok, start making the changes now la.

Seems to be more suited if the paper is specifically targeted to address design thinking.<br><br><i>Although its more clear, I think the objective should be teaching coding because it is not the end. Part of us wanting to teach coding is to increase digital literacy. Literacy is not just a skill but a knowledge. We want students to be able to see technology in a different way, not just see them as tools but to see them as how to control them and how they control us. So digital literacy is the bigger goal here, not just coding.</i>

You may also suggest that the teaching of coding is a part of a greater objective to increase digital literacy.<br><br><i>I think that is important. A lot of people think that being analytical or procedural means that is no creativity. While doing you compendium, we were saying that a lot of people thinks that setting rules and parameters makes design boring. But that is not true, sometimes the more rules the more it forces you to think creatively.<br><br>And the first paper seems to be more targeted to address design thinking or address the flaws or gaps that design thinking might have.

					<l>Introduction</l><br>
					Singapore’s design education is mainly split into two programme levels, Diploma and Degree in Bachelor of Arts. Government Polytechnics provides the necessary skillsets in diploma courses that are vocational (Liew) whereas, universities and private art colleges that offers degree courses are more research based. 
                    <span class="with-tooltip">Furthermore, design courses are gradually integrating coding lessons as part of their curriculum.<span class="tooltip">
                            <span class="tooltip-body">
                              <img src="contents/speech.png"  width="auto" height="10"> You may give an example to make this point otherwise it would seem like we are assuming this is true.<br><br><i>You can put “(Refer to appendix for full list), e.g. LaSalle has done things, or ADM has introduced coding classes in the first year. Just one example will do to make a point that you are not lying. You don’t need the year, you just need some form of coding in their curriculums. Because then it will become a long research to talk about, if you want to you can just use LaSalle to talk about it. Actually, we don’t have coding, its just that your year was the first year we introduce coding.</i>
                    </span></span></span> According to the Design Education Review Committee (DERC) report from 2017, Singapore's design education has
                    <span class="with-tooltip">adopted design thinking approach<span class="tooltip">
                        <span class="tooltip-body">
                              <img src="contents/speech.png"  width="auto" height="10"> I'm not sure if this part has been edited and corrected yet. You mentioned design thinking in this sentence but then the next jumps to focus on coding? The connection between the two is not made clear.<br><br><i>You can talk about how design thinking in Singapore (or the whole world) has this drive for coding and to increase digital literacy in its population. And you’re saying in design that is also that is also the general way it is going and you are saying that CD can help make the process; the learning curve a lot easier. Firstly, by looking at fundamentals of computational thinking. Secondly, by making it fun and creative that is not just learning hard coding or computing languages.<br><br>So you can just remove the design thinking thing if you want and focus on how Singapore has a drive for digital literacy uh. So not just about coding, when you talk about coding, you can say that coding is part of that drive for digital literacy but the main goal is to increase the digital literacy of students.</i>
                    </span></span></span> in design institutions (23). Although methodologies as such are greatly beneficial to the nation’s economy increasing opportunities for businesses and other industries to grow (URA 16) this creates a steep learning curve for design students to understand the logic behind coding.<br><br>

					In 2014, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and Ministry of Education (MOE) started implementing coding programmes by Code for Fun in mainstream education for <span class="with-tooltip">both primary and secondary schools<span class="tooltip">
                        <span class="tooltip-body">
                              <img src="contents/speech.png"  width="auto" height="10"> Should mention that although this is implemented in primary and secondary schools, it shows how important digital literacy and coding is for the future.<br><br><i>What it also shows is that how digital literacy in Singapore and coding is to future proof Singapore’s young population. DERC surprisingly did not talk about digital literacy which I think is a gap uh. Because they think that future proof is to teach them design thinking. *wrong answer buzzer</i>
                    </span></span></span>. The students get to learn about computational thinking and basic coding skills (Choo), developing <span class="with-tooltip">students problem-solving skills<span class="tooltip">
                        <span class="tooltip-body">
                              <img src="contents/speech.png"  width="auto" height="10"> Not only that, it should be mentioned that teaching coding is a part of increasing digital literacy in students to future-proof their learning for the future.<br><br>Should discuss digital literacy and how coding plays a role in it, and not just focus on coding alone because it feels like it is just teaching a skill but when view from the lens of digital literacy, coding because part of a body of knowledge and not just a skill alone.

This new way of learning would further enhance problem-solving skills by altering their perception towards any incoming issues. With that being said, it is absolutely necessary for design students to learn computational thinking. As Singapore’s general education system evolves, DesignSingapore Council (DSC) ought to reassess the current prevailing methods taught in design education.<br><br>

						Just to help you sort out the sections in a clearer format. You may consider:<br><l>1. Digital Literacy and coding</l><br>
                        Establish why digital literacy is important for the future and how coding is often taught as part of building digital literacy. Here you can cite your sources on how coding programmes have been implemented in primary and secondary schools.<br><br>
                        <l>2. Future-proofing designers in Singapore</l><br>
                        Here you can actually bring in DERC's objective where they want to future-proof design. Although they technically didn't mention coding or digital literacy in the report they have this sentence that you can build from: "the future economy requires more designers who can integrate knowledge and methods from different design disciplines, and operate in non-design contexts." They also mentioned points on design for future technological platforms. You can argue that future-proofing designers require us to build digital literacy to better understand how the world is shaping and being shaped by digital technologies. You can then argue that design curriculums have included coding in many of their programmes.<br><br><div class="b"><i>You can argue that part of future proof designers is to increase digital literacy. But DERC only talks about this... But one thing you can proof to it is that it calls us to integrate knowledge and methods from other design disciplines and coding is part of integrating different knowledge. They also mentioned that points about... Include one or two line.</i></div><br><br><l>3. Conditional Design and how they nurture not only one's understanding of coding but also of creativity.</l><br>This last part on creativity is important, because CD's approach is not just to learn coding, it is a creative approach. Which is why it is suited for designers as it encourages creative thinking too.<br><br><div class="b"><i>You can talk about what CD is. So far you haven’t talk about what CD is then you jumps straight in and say “(intro) ... by supplementing...” and assume that everyone knows what CD is. But you at least need a sentence or two to describe it. What you have previously is a long version of it. You can say “CD is a methodology proposed by ___ and they see it as a way of problem-solving”. You need to credit back to whoever did it also la.</i></div>

                    <l>Research Objective</l><br>
                    This paper aims to study how Conditional Design practices can supplement the design education in Singapore.<br><br>The primary objective of this paper is to understand how Condition Design can nurture a designer’s understanding of coding effectively.

                    </span></span></span> being used as the dominant way of thinking in design education by analysing the curriculums of existing design courses available in Singapore. This would better evaluate the competence of design practices and shift Singapore’s definition of what design practices are. Education in Singapore’s design schools should not be reduced solely as a platform to boost and support the nation’s economy but educated in knowledge and making.<br><br>The secondary objective of this paper is to propose the implementation of Conditional Design methodologies in existing institutions in Singapore. In doing so, design students would have a more holistic knowledge of their own design practices and be better equipped when entering the workforce in the future.

					<l>Summary of Readings</l><br>
					<b>Design Education in Singapore:</b><br>
                    According to Design 2025 Masterplan, Singapore poses strong emphasis on the business aspect towards design urging the direction of design to be aligned with the nation’s mindset. However, this funnels down the potential of design studies by measuring its commercial value. The ways of thinking can be brought into application in daily aspects of life not just towards design practices itself.<br><br>

                    By introducing design thinking in design education as a dominant way of thinking sets the nation up to foster greater compassion for the people. Students from governmental schools like Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP) and Singapore Polytechnic (SP) are given the opportunity to tackle local societal issues as part of their curriculum helps to promote positive budding initiatives (DERC 2017). This human-centered approach helps to unifies the community cultivating the next generation of industry design professionals.<br><br>

                    <b>The Effects of Design Thinking as a Dominant Paradigm:</b><br>
                    The methods of design thinking are rather outcome-oriented.<br><br>

                    In 2008, Amsterdam based designers, Luna Maurer, Jonathan Puckey, Roel Wouters and Edo Paulus introduced a new way of thinking called <span class="with-tooltip">Conditional Design<span class="tooltip">
                        <span class="tooltip-body">

                        </span></span></span>. It is composed of three main principles, <span class="with-tooltip">process, logic and input<span class="tooltip">
                            <span class="tooltip-body">

                        </span></span></span>. The term Conditional Design simply means designs with conditions that requires participants to work with the limits of the given framework. Using algorithmic thinking approach, only methods of ‘philosophers, engineers, inventors and mystics’, they believe that conditions formulated with clarity and precision around an idea is necessary (Maurer et al.). In this way, the conditional designer is able to minimise possible issues that might surface during the process as well as to further guide the process. <span class="with-tooltip">+<span class="tooltip">

                        <br><br>Unlike design thinking which is outcome based, <span class="with-tooltip">Conditional Design focuses on the process than the outcome itself<span class="tooltip">

                        </span></span></span>. Though these sets of framework can be repeatedly applied, it is nowhere near rigidity as the input is the participants themselves which would result in arbitrary outcomes. This challenges participants to “think within the box” and expand their creativity. <span class="with-tooltip">+<span class="tooltip">

For this reason, the primary research will question students, alumni,  educators and conditional designers to gain greater understanding through their thoughts and experiences.<br><br>

They come in to design not thinking about coding but we say “this is how you do things in C++ or Javascript.” In fact in the earlier conversations, I talked about CD as an easier way to understand coding principles and then I’m glad that he further the discussion with Dhiya and get him on board in this. You can speak to Andreas on this.<br><br>You might want to interview BA1 & BA2. But for your studio you might want to develop a methodology or working with CD. It could also be working with BA1, you can think about what if you were to do things different for different levels. It almost become a full kits of sorts to your FYP. So there are some methods that applies to BA1, some to BA2 and some BA3.</i>

                        Just a note after reading about the draft, it seems like the paper constantly want to place design thinking and coding (digital literacy) together but does not yet do a good job in articulating how they are connected.<br><br>If you personally feel that CD can be an antidote to design thinking, then the paper should be focus on that.<br><br>If you think the gap and opportunity is with how CD can be a creative means of nurturing digital literacy and coding, then that should be the focus.
