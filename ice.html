                For this module, I've decided to group with Joanne Goh focusing on a local gym studio called Activ.Co. Moving forward we needed to ask her a set of questions in order to get to know the onwer and the gym better.
                <br><br>

                <b>Information Gathered From Self Research</b><br>
                Activ.Co is an all women's gym founded by Annisa Rahim. The team believes in helping their clients build up their confidences, health or even preparing to transit into motherhood. As of Sep 2020, they have two gyms islandwide; one each in the North and East.

                <img src="contents/dollar.png"  width="auto" height="15"> The information written in the website under the 'About Us' sections was not clear as to when they started this company or what their beliefs are. For now there is nothing I can do besides diagnosing their available online platforms. Annisa mentioned that the website is currently hosted by Wix. The web is not responsive and the text goes kinda wonky. From what I can see, it is in desperate need of a saviour, haha. Currently clients are asked to download Wix moblie app and to be able to view the web without any text going crazy. Activ's insta page is still pretty ok just abit inconsistent design wise however they stick true to the post system which is great. Also, I've noticed that the logo and typeface used throughout are multiple different fonts.

                <br><br>
                <b>Possible Questions to Ask</b><br>
                - Can you tell us something more about yourself? (e.g. hobbies, beliefs, quotes...)<br>
                - How did it all started? Tell us more about the history of Activ Co.<br>
                - What is so special about Activ Co? (I've noticed that this is an all women's gym, why?)<br>
                - How/what would like us to help you with?<br>
                - What are the current issue(s) you're facing?<br>
                - Who are your direct competitors?<br>
                - What do you expect at the end of this project?<br>

                <h1>Case Studies of Exsisting Competitors</h1>
                While waiting for her response, we've decided to go ahead and research more on her competitors or others of the similar services. I've realised that commonality that most gyms have is an overall bold typeface, dark coloured theme that shows strength, impact and empowerment. There is two that examples in particular that stood out from the rest.

                <div class="b">
                At times when I was scrolling through the website I felt that I had to work for it abit too hard. For e.g. when I'm already at a certain page, my mouse have to reach on the top left <i>*cues animation load</i>, click on a category <i>*cues animation load</i> in which would expand and would have to click again to select specific section. This destination alone took 3 clicks and 2 pauses, it might be a bias opinion but I felt that websites should not have much animations to begin with as it would slow down the viewing experience. In instances like this I felt that it is more efficient with all related sections would merge into a single page. As you can <a href="https://uppercutboxing.com/concept/"target="_blank">see</a>, each page height is relatively short which is kinda wasted space.

                The hidden gem of this website was the copywriting done for each of the staff members nicely injected with humour. It is well personalised

                <div class="b">
                Brave Shapes has a very clear and straightforward webpage that is easy to navigate around. Personally, we felt that TBS is a great example as they had set a consistent tone of voice as a brand throughout and in their copywriting. They managed to balance off the minimalistic  aesthetics with a casual photography. The photographic style shows the friendly and fun side of the staffs which is something great because gyms can sometimes be quite intimidating. Overall it is simple and well constructed, it is nothing too complex that becomes confusing for the (potential) clients which kinda makes it fast to load too it is a good thing.
