                For this module, I've decided to group with Joanne Goh focusing on a local gym studio called Activ.Co. Moving forward we needed to ask her a set of questions in order to get to know the onwer and the gym better.
                <br><br>

                <b>Information Gathered From Self Research</b><br>
                Activ.Co is an all women's gym founded by Annisa Rahim. The team believes in helping their clients build up their confidences, health or even preparing to transit into motherhood. As of Sep 2020, they have two gyms islandwide; one each in the North and East.

                <img src="contents/dollar.png"  width="auto" height="15"> The information written in the website under the 'About Us' sections was not clear as to when they started this company or what their beliefs are. For now there is nothing I can do besides diagnosing their available online platforms. Annisa mentioned that the website is currently hosted by Wix. The web is not responsive and the text goes kinda wonky. From what I can see, it is in desperate need of a saviour, haha. Currently clients are asked to download Wix moblie app and to be able to view the web without any text going crazy. Activ's insta page is still pretty ok just abit inconsistent design wise however they stick true to the post system which is great. Also, I've noticed that the logo and typeface used throughout are multiple different fonts.

                <b>Possible Questions to Ask</b><br>
                - Can you tell us something more about yourself? (e.g. hobbies, beliefs, quotes...)<br>
                - How did it all started? Tell us more about the history of Activ Co.<br>
                - What is so special about Activ Co? (I've noticed that this is an all women's gym, why?)<br>
                - How/what would like us to help you with?<br>
                - What are the current issue(s) you're facing?<br>
                - Who are your direct competitors?<br>
                - What do you expect at the end of this project?<br>
