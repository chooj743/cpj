                <h1>Option B: Negotiated Projects — Entrepreneurial Project</h1>
                For this module, I've decided to group with Joanne Goh (22005) focusing on a local all women's gym studio called Activ.Co which she goes to. Joanne shared her thoughts with me on how the website can better improved. So we decided to propose the project to the boss of Activ.Co about this project. Thereafter, we started researching the brand. Disclaimer: Before you read this CPJ any further I would like to give you some conext first. I do not like to excercise and I don't excercise, haha! So my point of view is coming from a rather foreign perspective.<br><br>

                #MoveWithActivCo<br><br>
                <l>Background and Objectives</l><br>
                Launched in March 2019, Activ.Co is an all-female hybrid fitness gym founded by Annisa Rahim. Annisa was a full-time trainer in a boutique gym in the town area before getting fired then decided on opening a studio because she believes that there’s a lack of affordable, women-only studios in Singapore. The team believes in helping their clients build up their confidences, health or even preparing to transit into motherhood. As of Sep 2020, they have two gyms islandwide; one each in the North and East.<br><br>

                <div class="a">
                After a few great attempts to dig up information online from their social media platform, the story about Activ.Co remains pretty much unknown as it did not mention anything helpful. I couldn't even find the name of the owner if it was not for Joanne. On their social media platforms and website, it did not state who was behind this, when it was established, how was it formed, who was it for, what are the beliefs, who are the trainers, etc. The ‘About Us’ section on their website mainly talks about what services and classes they provide and the direction to get to the studios.<br><br>
                I felt a need to get to know more about the owner and the gym better rather than reading all these irrelevant information from the website but will wait till after the ICE briefing to know what we are supposed to do. In the meanwhile, since I can't do much yet, I wanted to check the website out without much context first. In my opinion, this would help to understand what experiences and thoughts coming from a consumers' perspective.

                This unresponsive webpage are not fitted and pinned to the bottom and not optimised to various platform dimensions. Therefore users with different screen size would have issues viewing it.

                The website displayed bad typography tracking that needs to be improved as it is too tight for readability. Multiple typefaces are used throughout the website. The headers, body and subtitles are using different fonts. The legibility of words against images is completely overlooked. There are overwhelming amounts of text are on the image when it could have been better treated with text left on the description box.

                Currently users have to download the WIX app then key in the invite code provided for the mobile member view to continue with class bookings. While it is easy to use, it did not show information that was shown on the website. It should be able to show at least the same amount of content or information even on mobile view.

                The Instagram pages has an overwhelming amount of information in both profile section and each post. Despite the inconsistent design on each post, Activ.Co sticks true to Instagram’s 3x3 grid post system.

                The copywriting was written with honesty, clarity and humour especially the short description for each of the staff members. It was well written and balanced in humour and seriousness.<br><br>
                <l>Things we can improve on</l><br>
                This website is far too organised, having too many different categories and sub-categories. Despite the clear interface, navigating throughout the website with menus that display transitional animations makes it rather tiring and laggy. The cover photograph on each page was a bit excessive on the quantities and height used. Rather than having a larger area for text or compiling sub-categories together Uppercut Boxing used it for photos.

                <l>Things we can learn from</l><br>
                The Brave Shapes has a very clear and straightforward webpage that is easy to navigate around. The copywriting managed to get information across to users with providing too length text. The photographic style shows the friendly and fun side of the staff which is something great because gyms can sometimes be quite intimidating. Overall it is simple and well constructed, it is nothing too complex that becomes confusing for the (potential) clients which kinda makes it fast to load too it is a good thing. Indeed a great example balancing between imagery and text.<br><br>
                <l>Things we can improve on</l><br>
                Due to the minimalist aesthetics and professionalism tone? of the brand it seems to be that it lacks personality...
