                For this module, I've decided to group with Joanne Goh focusing on a local all women's gym studio called Activ.Co. Joanne knows about this studio as she has been attending this gym for almost 2 years now. She felt that the website needed help and since this module is the perfect opportunity she went ahead to share with the boss in which she happily agreed to this project.<br><br>
                We both felt a need to get to know more about the owner and her gym better rather than reading from her website but will wait till after the ICE briefing to know what we are supposed to do. In the meanwhile, since we can't do much yet, we wanted to check the website out without much context first. In my opinion, this would help to understand what experience and thoughts from a consumers' perspective.<br><br>

                <b>Information Gathered From Joanne</b><br>
                Activ.Co is an all women's gym founded by Annisa Rahim. The team believes in helping their clients build up their confidences, health or even preparing to transit into motherhood. As of Sep 2020, they have two gyms islandwide; one each in the North and East.

                After few great attempts to dig up information from the existing platforms the information or story about the company remains pretty much unknown. The company did not state who was behind this, when it was established, why it was formed and who was it for, what are the beliefs, who are the trainers, etc. The <a href="https://www.activco.net/about" target="_blank">About Us</a> section mainly talks about what services they provides and the direction to get to the gym studios.<br><br>

                <img src="contents/dollar.png"  width="auto" height="15"> For now there is nothing I can do besides nitpicking their available online platforms. Annisa mentioned that the website is currently hosted by Wix. The web is not responsive and the text goes kinda wonky. From what I can see, it is in desperate need of a saviour, haha. Currently clients are asked to download Wix mobile app and to be able to view the web without any text going crazy. Activ's insta page is still pretty ok just a bit inconsistent design wise however they stick true to the post system which is great. Also, I've noticed that the logo and typeface used throughout are multiple different fonts.

                <b>Possible Questions to Ask</b><br>
                - Can you tell us something more about yourself? (e.g. hobbies, beliefs, quotes...)<br>
                - How did it all started? Tell us more about the history of Activ Co.<br>
                - What is so special about Activ Co? (I've noticed that this is an all women's gym, why?)<br>
                - How/what would like us to help you with?<br>
                - What are the current issue(s) you're facing?<br>
                - Who are your direct competitors?<br>
                - What do you expect at the end of this project?<br>

                <h1>Case Studies of Existing Competitors</h1>
                While waiting for her response, we've decided to go ahead and research more on her competitors or others of the similar services. I've realised that the commonality that most gyms have is an overall bold typeface, dark coloured theme that shows strength, impact and empowerment. There are two examples in particular that stood out from the rest.

                Uppercut Boxing | <a href="https://www.uppercutboxing.com/"target="_blank">Website</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/uppercutboxing/"target="_blank">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uppercutboxingsg"target="_blank">Facebook</a>
                <div class="b">
                At times when I was scrolling through the website I felt that I had to work for it abit too hard. For e.g. when I'm already at a certain page, my mouse have to reach on the top left <i>*cues animation load</i>, click on a category <i>*cues animation load</i> in which would expand and would have to click again to select specific section. This destination alone took 3 clicks and 2 pauses, it might be a bias opinion but I felt that websites should not have much animations to begin with as it would slow down the viewing experience. In instances like this I felt that it is more efficient with all related sections would merge into a single page. As you can <a href="https://uppercutboxing.com/concept/"target="_blank">see</a>, each page height is relatively short which is kinda wasted space.
                <br><br>
                The hidden gem of this website was the copywriting done for each of the staff members nicely injected with humour. It is well personalised

                <div class="b">
                Brave Shapes has a very clear and straightforward webpage that is easy to navigate around. Personally, we felt that TBS is a great example as they had set a consistent tone of voice as a brand throughout and in their copywriting. They managed to balance off the minimalistic aesthetics with casual photography. The photographic style shows the friendly and fun side of the staff which is something great because gyms can sometimes be quite intimidating. Overall it is simple and well constructed, it is nothing too complex that becomes confusing for the (potential) clients which kinda makes it fast to load too it is a good thing.
